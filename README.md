# Engageli Custom GPT Crawler

## engageli-support-ai

Crawl a site to generate knowledge files to create your own custom GPT from one or multiple URLs

## Example

[Try it out yourself](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-S8P11mytI-engageligpt) by asking questions about Engageli platform.

> Note that you may need a paid ChatGPT plan to access this feature

## Get started

### Prerequisites

Be sure you have Node.js >= 16 installed

### Clone the repo

```sh
git clone https://github.com/builderio/gpt-crawler
```

### Install Dependencies

```sh
npm i
```

If you do not have Playwright installed:

```sh
npx playwright install
```

### Configure the crawler

Open [config.ts](config.ts) and edit the `url` and `selectors` properties to match your needs.

E.g. to crawl the Builder.io docs to make our custom GPT you can use:

```ts
export const config: Config = {
  url: "https://xxxxxxxx",
  match: "https://xxxxxxxxx/**",
  selector: `.docs-builder-container`,
  maxPagesToCrawl: 50,
  outputFileName: "output.json",
};
```

See the top of the file for the type definition for what you can configure:

```ts
type Config = {
  /** URL to start the crawl */
  url: string;
  /** Pattern to match against for links on a page to subsequently crawl */
  match: string;
  /** Selector to grab the inner text from */
  selector: string;
  /** Don't crawl more than this many pages */
  maxPagesToCrawl: number;
  /** File name for the finished data */
  outputFileName: string;
  /** Optional function to run for each page found */
  onVisitPage?: (options: {
    page: Page;
    pushData: (data: any) => Promise<void>;
  }) => Promise<void>;
  /** Optional timeout for waiting for a selector to appear */
  waitForSelectorTimeout?: number;
};
```

### Run your crawler

```sh
npm start
```

### Upload your data to OpenAI

The crawl will generate a file called `output.json` at the root of this project. Upload that [to OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/docs/assistants/overview) to create your custom assistant or custom GPT.
