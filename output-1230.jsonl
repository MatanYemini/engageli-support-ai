Tables are built so learners will always be in small groups and you do not need to create breakout rooms for group activities. This allows you to create rich learning experiences at the tables while learners also feel simultaneously connected to the larger class and the instructor.\n\n\u00a0\n\nJoining Tables\n\nCreating Random Tables Groups\u00a0\n\nMoving learners to different Tables\n\n\u00a0\n\nJoining Tables\n\nJoining tables allows you to leave the podium and \u201cvisit\u201d groups of learners at tables, much like \u201cwalking the room\u201d in an in-person class. This is great for any group work or discussions.\n\nInstructions\n1. To join a table, click the Tables tab.\n2. Hover over the table that you'd like to join and click the JOIN button.\n\nWhen you join the table, you will see, hear, and interact only with members of the table you joined. This is great when groups have a question on an in-class assignment and you don't want to interrupt the entire class.\n\n3. When you are ready to leave the table, click the Back to podium button. Engageli 3.1 users have several options for returning to the podium.\n\nNote: The audio will automatically switch from Room Mode to Table Mode. When you leave the table, you will have to switch the audio setting back to Room Mode to enable a full-class discussion. Click to learn more about the audio settings.\n\nNew in Engageli 3.1!\n\nIn Engageli 3.1, instructors will peek at or observe tables unobtrusively without disturbing the learners.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nCreating Random Tables Groups\u00a0\n\nThis is a great way to encourage learner engagement is to randomly arrange table groups for discussions.\u00a0\n\nInstructions\n\n1. Go to the Seating Arrangement drop-down menu in the Tables view.\u00a0\n\n2. Select Random Arrangement Table Size.\n\n3. Choose the number of learners you would like at each table. The system will automatically break learners into randomized groups.\n\nYou can also reserve any of the first 3 tables for staff or other participants who you don't want to move during the random arrangement. In Engageli 3.0, this is called Skip Tables.\n\nNote: If learners have a reservation, then they will be treated as learners. Make sure to remove any reservations before you do this! (See instructions on reservations here).\n\nYou can save the table arrangement you created as a preset that you can use again. Click for information on how to create a table preset during a class.\n\n\u00a0\n\nMoving Learners to Different Tables\u00a0\n\nInstructions\n1. Navigate to the Tables view.\n2. Click the profile icon of the learner you wish to move.\n\n3. Choose a new table for the learner from the drop-down menu.\n\n4.

This is great for brainstorming sessions, in-class group assignments, worksheets, or presentation preparation.\n\nNote: This feature is best used for files that you want learners to edit together in class. If you wish to simply share notes, presentations, or other files with the class, it is best to upload the file in the Chat. A comprehensive guide on how to use the chat can be found here.\n\nClass Document and Table Documents\nDistribute Documents in Class\nPrepare Shared Table Documents in the Admin Portal\nClass Document and Table Documents\n\nYou distribute two kinds of documents in Engageli: a class document or table documents.\n\nA class document is a file that opens for the entire class to view and edit directly on the Engageli screen.\n\nWhen to use: You can use this feature to distribute a file to learners to collaborate in real-time for full class contributions/activities.\n\nA table document is a file that opens for a particular table. You can have the same file open or different files for different tables.\n\nWhen to use: You can use this feature to distribute a file to learners to collaborate in real-time on table-based activities, peer-to-peer instruction, station-based work, case studies per table, etc. You can distribute:\nOne document shared with all tables\nIndividual documents shared per table\n\nFor either a class document or separate table documents, you can share the following types of files:\n\nGoogle Document, Sheet, and Slides\nMicrosoft 365 Word, Excel, and Powerpoint\n\nNote: Microsoft 365 files open within Engageli in view-only mode. For editing, the files will open in a new tab.\n\nDistribute Documents in Class\n\nYou can distribute documents in class without any prior setup.\n\n1. Start your class.\n\n2. When you are ready to distribute the documents, click the Present button at the bottom of the screen.\n\n3. Select either Distribute Doc or Distribute Docs.\n\n4. For a classroom doc, paste the link to the file you want to share and then click the Share button.\n\n5. For table documents, select the set of files you want to share if you added them to the Admin Portal before class, or click the plus sign to add the links.\n\nNote: You have to add links for each table, even if it\u2019s the same file for each table.\n\nPro tip! Save time by adding table document links to the Admin Portal before class. Add them in the Materials section. At this time, shared class document links cannot be added beforehand, only shared table documents.\n\n6. Learners will then see the document you have shared and be able to edit directly on the documents.\u00a0\n\nYou can change the links to be shared at any point during the class.\n\nAfter enabling a shared doc, you will see a prompt to change the classroom audio to Table Mode.\n\n7. When you are ready to collect the documents, click the Present button again, and then Stop. After clicking, learners will no longer be able to see or edit the document.\n\nPrepare Shared Table Documents\u00a0in the Admin Portal\n\n1. Go to the Admin Portal.\n\n2. Click Class Management on the left to expand the menu.\n\n3. Select your class or use the search field to find your class.\n\n4. Click Materials.\u00a0\u00a0\n\n5. If you have sub-rooms created, click which room you want to add materials to, and then select the plus sign.\n\n6. Give the set a name.\n\n7. Select which type of files you want to share (G-Suite or Office 365).\n\n8. Click Add.\n\n9. Paste the shared links for the files you want to distribute in class. You can distribute one document per table. Learners seated at that table will be shown that document after activating the feature during class.\u00a0\n\n10. Confirm that the linked documents are made editable for/by your class before distributing them. You should do this directly in the Google file or Microsoft 365 file that you plan to share.\n\n\u00a0\n\nGoogle Suite Microsoft 365\n.\u00a0 \n\n\u00a0Need more help?

Tables are built so learners will always be in small groups and you do not need to create breakout rooms for group activities. This allows you to create rich learning experiences at the tables while learners also feel simultaneously connected to the larger class and the instructor.\n\n\u00a0\n\nJoining Tables\n\nCreating Random Tables Groups\u00a0\n\nMoving learners to different Tables\n\n\u00a0\n\nJoining Tables\n\nJoining tables allows you to leave the podium and \u201cvisit\u201d groups of learners at tables, much like \u201cwalking the room\u201d in an in-person class. This is great for any group work or discussions.\n\nInstructions\n1. To join a table, click the Tables tab.\n2. Hover over the table that you'd like to join and click the JOIN button.\n\nWhen you join the table, you will see, hear, and interact only with members of the table you joined. This is great when groups have a question on an in-class assignment and you don't want to interrupt the entire class.\n\n3. When you are ready to leave the table, click the Back to podium button. Engageli 3.1 users have several options for returning to the podium.\n\nNote: The audio will automatically switch from Room Mode to Table Mode. When you leave the table, you will have to switch the audio setting back to Room Mode to enable a full-class discussion. Click to learn more about the audio settings.\n\nNew in Engageli 3.1!\n\nIn Engageli 3.1, instructors will peek at or observe tables unobtrusively without disturbing the learners.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nCreating Random Tables Groups\u00a0\n\nThis is a great way to encourage learner engagement is to randomly arrange table groups for discussions.\u00a0\n\nInstructions\n\n1. Go to the Seating Arrangement drop-down menu in the Tables view.\u00a0\n\n2. Select Random Arrangement Table Size.\n\n3. Choose the number of learners you would like at each table. The system will automatically break learners into randomized groups.\n\nYou can also reserve any of the first 3 tables for staff or other participants who you don't want to move during the random arrangement. In Engageli 3.0, this is called Skip Tables.\n\nNote: If learners have a reservation, then they will be treated as learners. Make sure to remove any reservations before you do this! (See instructions on reservations here).\n\nYou can save the table arrangement you created as a preset that you can use again. Click for information on how to create a table preset during a class.\n\n\u00a0\n\nMoving Learners to Different Tables\u00a0\n\nInstructions\n1. Navigate to the Tables view.\n2. Click the profile icon of the learner you wish to move.\n\n3. Choose a new table for the learner from the drop-down menu.\n\n4. Or, you can simply drag and drop the learner to a different table.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0Need more help?

Browser-based instructors should click here for instructions.\nThere are many ways to track engagement in Engageli, for individual learners as well as the entire class. These markers can help you keep a pulse on how the class is engaging with and learning the content so you can adjust as needed.\n\n\u00a0\n\nClass Engagement\n\nIndividual Engagement Markers\n\n\u00a0\n\nClass Engagement\n\n(Note: At this time, class markers are only available if you are teaching on the instructor application.)\n\n\u00a0\n\n1. Emojis: The Emoji Thermometer measures learner sentiment. Learners have four emoji options: red, orange, yellow, and green. As learners answer, the thermometer will move up and down. All answers are anonymous, so you will get the aggregate of the responses.\u00a0\n\nSome example questions to use with Emojis are:\n\n\"How are you feeling today?\"\n\"How confident are you in the material we just covered?\"\n\n2. The Bowtie Thermometer measures aggregate class engagement. As learners interact with the platform, the engagement bar will move up and down.\u00a0\n\nExamples of platform engagement are: raising hands, chatting, asking questions in Q&A, answering polls/quizzes, giving thumbs up or down, etc.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIndividual Engagement Markers\n\nIn addition to tracking full class engagement with the engagement thermometers, you can also track individual learner engagement.\n\n\u00a0\n\n1. Thumbs up/thumbs down: You can ask learners to give you a thumbs up or down. Everyone will see the thumbs appear instantly on the screen, but only instructors and TAs will see individual thumbs up/thumbs down on the learners' video feeds in the Class Gallery.\n\nThumbs up or down can be used to get quick feedback, check understanding, or check if learners are paying attention. Some example questions to use with thumbs are:\n\n\"Do you understand the material we just covered?\"\n\"Give me a thumbs up if you can see my screen.\"\n\nPro Tip! Use thumbs up or down to check engagement for learners with their cameras off. When coming back after a break, if many learners turned off their cameras, ask for a thumbs up if learners are back and then look at the class gallery to see how many thumbs up there are.\n\n\u00a0 Engageli 3.0\u00a0\nIn Engageli 3.0, there are new reactions and sounds for learners and instructors. Click here to learn more.\n\n2. Green Dot marker\n\nEach learner has an engagement marker next to their video feed on the gallery view of the instructor application.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe green dot marker represents when a learner is \"active,\" meaning that they have recently interacted in the classroom in some way. The green dot resets to the maximum size (5) each time a learner does one of the following:\n\nWrites a question or answer in Q&A\nResponds to a poll question\nRaises a hand\nShares screen with their table\nShares screen with their class\nUses thumbs up/down\nUses emojis\nInitiates audio activity (speaking, unmuting microphone)\n\nNote: The green marker decays and appears smaller after some time. The decay is linear, from maximum (5) to minimum (0) over three minutes. Hovering over the indicator in a learner\u2019s video feed shows an engagement value out of 5 (Engagement - 5/5). Any form of activity listed above will turn the marker green.\n\nThe gray dot marker replaces the green markers when a learner who was previously active has not recently interacted in the classroom. In general, a green marker will turn gray after three minutes. The gray marker corresponds to an Engagement rating of 0/5.\nNo marker simply means the learner has not interacted in the classroom at any point.\nThe perforated (dotted) marker indicates that a learner who was seated at a table has left the class. They are still represented in the class by what's called a reservation, as explained in this article.\n\nYou can also see the green dot marker in the LISTS view.\n\n\u00a0\n\n3. Table Engagement\n\nIn addition to the learner\u2019s video feed and LISTS view, the individual engagement markers trigger an engagement indication at the table level, which you can see in the TABLES view.\n\nSimilar to the green dot marker, the green table ring decays and fades away after some time due to inactivity. The decay is linear, from maximum (5) to minimum (0) over three minutes.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0Need more help?

These markers can help you keep a pulse on how the class is engaging with and learning the content so you can adjust as needed.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIndividual Engagement Markers\n\n1. Thumbs up/thumbs down\n\nYou can ask learners to use the reactions to give you a thumbs up or down. Everyone will see the thumbs appear instantly on the screen, but only instructors and TAs will see individual thumbs up/thumbs down on the learners' video feeds in the Class Gallery.\n\nThumbs up or down can be used to get quick feedback, check understanding, or check if learners are paying attention. Some example questions to use with thumbs are:\n\n\"Do you understand the material we just covered?\"\n\"Give me a thumbs up if you can see my screen.\"\n\nPro Tip! Use thumbs up or down to check engagement for learners with their cameras off. When coming back after a break, if many learners turned off their cameras, ask for a thumbs up if learners are back and then look at the class gallery to see how many thumbs up there are.\n\nThere are additional reactions and sounds for learners and instructors. Click here to learn more.\u00a0\n\n2. Green Dot Marker\n\nEach learner has an engagement marker in the bottom right corner of their video feed in the Class Gallery.\n\nThe green dot marker represents when a learner is \"active,\" meaning that they have recently interacted in the classroom in some way. The green dot resets to the maximum size (5) each time a learner does one of the following:\n\nWrites a question or answer in Q&A\nResponds to a poll question\nRaises hand\nLowers hand\nShares screen with their table\nShares screen with their class\nUses thumbs up/down\nUses other emojis reactions\nSends a chat message (private chats are not included)\nInitiates audio activity (speaking, unmuting microphone)\n\nNote: The green marker decays and appears smaller after some time. The decay is linear, from maximum (5) to minimum (0) over three minutes. Hovering over the indicator in a learner\u2019s video feed shows an engagement value out of 5 (Engagement - 5/5). Any form of activity listed above will turn the marker green.\n\nThe gray dot marker replaces the green markers when a learner who was previously active has not recently interacted in the classroom. In general, a green marker will turn gray after three minutes. The gray marker corresponds to an Engagement rating of 0/5.\n\nNo marker simply means the learner has not interacted in the classroom at any point.\n\nThe perforated (dotted) marker indicates that a learner who was seated at a table has left the class. They are still represented in the class by what's called a reservation, as explained in this article.\n\nYou can also see the green dot marker next to the learner's name in the List view in the Tables tab.\n\n\u00a0\n\nTable Engagement\n\nIn addition to the learner\u2019s video feed and the Lists view, the individual engagement markers trigger an engagement indication at the table level, which you can see in the Tables tab at the top of the screen.\n\nSimilar to the green dot marker, the green table ring decays and fades away after some time due to inactivity. The decay is linear, from maximum (5) to minimum (0) over three minutes.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0Need more help?

Browser-based instructors should click here for instructions.\nEngageli tables are strategically designed to increase collaboration between learners. Tables are built so learners will always be in small groups so there is no need to create breakout rooms for activities. This allows you to create rich learning experiences at the tables, while learners also feel simultaneously connected to the larger class and the instructor.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAdd Tables\n\t\nRename Tables\n\n\nChange the Number of Seats at Tables\n\t\nRemove Table Reservations\n\n\u00a0\n\nAdd Tables\n\nAn Engageli classroom opens with 5 tables, each with 10 seats, by default. As the tables fill with learners, more tables are added automatically. However, you can manually add tables 5 at a time with no more than 40 recommended.\n\nInstructions\n\n1. Navigate to the Tables view.\n\n2. Click the Actions menu.\n\n3. Select Add 5 tables.\n\nNOTE: At this time, you cannot remove tables that have been added to the classroom.\n\n\u00a0\nRename Tables\n\nYou can easily rename the tables in your Engageli classroom. Table names can mirror the instructional model and range from project group names, book characters, or course topics to fun names based on hobbies or interests.\n\nInstructions\n\nDuring Class\n\n1. Go to the TABLES view.\n\n2. Hover over the table you want to rename.\n\n3. Click the existing name of the table.\n\n4. Enter the new name.\n\n5. Click the table to save the change.\n\n6. You will see a confirmation notification at the top of the screen.\n\nNote: The new table names will be saved and persist in the Admin Portal and the next time you log into the classroom.\n\nAdmin Portal\n\n1. Go to the Admin Portal.\n\n2. Click Class Management\u00a0on the left to expand the menu.\u00a0\n\n3. Select your class or use the search field to find your class.\u00a0\n\n4. Click Tables & Preset.\n\n5. Select the row for the table.\n\n6. Enter the new table name.\n\n7. Press Return or Enter on your computer.\n\n8. You will see a confirmation notification at the bottom of the screen.\n\n\u00a0\n\nChange the Number of Seats at Tables\n\nBy default, an Engageli classroom opens with the maximum number of seats allowed at a table: 10. As an instructor, you can easily change the number of seats at a table.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nEngageli classroom with 10 seats per table\n\n\u00a0\n\nInstructions\n\n1. Click the gear icon to open the settings.\n\n2. Select Classroom Configuration.\n\n3. Use the slider to select the number of seats for the tables.\n\n4. Click the Close button. The changes will be applied immediately.\n\nPro Tip! When deciding the number of seats, keep in mind that if you have multiple TAs who will visit tables, an available empty seat will be needed. Instructors, co-instructors, and one TA can visit tables without needing an empty seat.\n\nEngageli classroom with 5 seats per table\n\n\u00a0\n\nRemove Table Reservations\n\nTable reservations ensure that a learner can keep their spot at a table should they lose their internet connection and get logged out of the classroom. When the learner re-joins the classroom, they will automatically be placed at the same table as before. Because of having an assigned seat at the table, a table of seven present learners and three reserved is considered full.\n\nYou may want to remove table reservations to free up space at certain tables or create random table groups without including reservations in the count.\n\nWithin Tables view, you can see all reservations represented by a dotted line around a learner\u2019s profile icon.\n\n\u00a0\n\nInstructions\n\n1. Go to the TABLES view.\n\n2. In the drop-down menu Action, select Remove All Reservations.\u00a0\n\n3. You can remove an individual reservation by clicking on the learner's icon at the table and then removing it.\u00a0\n\nNote: Individual reservations will be automatically removed after 5 minutes of inactivity.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0Need more help?

Based on feedback from partners, we've redesigned the Engageli classroom to better support teaching and active learning and provide a flexible learning environment for all participants. In addition to a variety of new features, Engageli\u2019s team has enhanced the overall teaching and learning experience in many ways.\u00a0\n\nNew Features\n\nAccessibility\n\nDeaf and hard-of-hearing users can now learn with a dedicated sign language interpreter. Users can overlay the interpreter\u2019s video over their classroom windows and customize the size and placement of the video at any time.\u00a0\n\nAsynchronous Experience\n\nInstructors can now customize the asynchronous experience. They can upload external videos to be viewed in an Engageli Playback Room, or upload PDFs for learners to access. They can also edit and trim class recordings to share the best version of the class with learners.\u00a0\n\nChat, Notes, Q&A\n\nThe new and improved chat allows users to filter and search for chat messages for better ease of use. Browser users can take and annotate screenshots in the chat and reply and add reactions (thumbs, hearts, etc.) to messages.\n\nIn-class Teaching Tools\n\nThe Distributed Docs feature has been enhanced to include Google Sheets and Slides and Microsoft 365 Word, Excel, and Powerpoint files. Instructors can share a file for class-wide collaboration as well as add and edit shared files during the class session, instead of preloading in the Admin Portal.\u00a0\nNew emojis and sounds have been added as reactions to enable users to give clear and immediate feedback. Instructors can customize the settings for the reactions.\n\nAdmin Portal\n\nThe Admin Portal has been updated with new classroom filters and search capabilities, automatically enabled classroom guest links, and a calendar invitation option that makes setting up classes easier. Instructors and admins can now filter the Chat, Poll, Speak Time, and Hand Raise analytics by date range.\u00a0\n\nPlease select an accordion to learn about Engageli 3.0 Enhancements and Resolved Issues.\u00a0\n\nEnhancements\nResolved Issues\n\n\u00a0Need more help?

With the inclusion of this extension, institutions can leverage Deep Linking to provide a seamless launch experience between Canvas and Engageli.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIf you've created Course A in Canvas and want to link it to Course B and Course C, you'll need to launch Course A from Canvas as an instructor via the Engageli link before linking. Once you've launched Course A as an instructor it will create the course in Engageli and then you'll have the option to link to it when you create Course B and Course C.\n\n\u00a0\n\nUse Case\n\nThe Deep Linking extension allows an institution to link one Canvas course to multiple Engageli classrooms, keeping data analytics intact. For example, this allows one Canvas course to link to separate Engageli classrooms, one for live sessions and one for group collaboration.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0Need more help?

Based on feedback from partners, we've improved the Engageli classroom to better support teaching and active learning and provide a flexible learning environment for all participants. In addition to a variety of new features, Engageli\u2019s team has enhanced the overall teaching and learning experience in many ways.\u00a0\n\nExciting New Features\nDial-in support (Beta)\nFor U.S. customers only\nLearners without access to a computer or mobile app can dial into the classroom.\nLock Tables\u00a0\nInstructors can lock tables to stop learners from moving between tables to better manage their learners and class activities.\nPeek at Tables\nInstructors can now observe table activities unobtrusively without interrupting the learners.\nTwo Instructors Using Web Browsers\nTwo users on web browsers can act as instructors, as opposed to needing the instructor application as in previous versions.\nCollaboration Spaces\nNew Playback Room features allow for collaboration spaces where learners can review course material and complete assignments and supplemental material in groups.\nSelf-Paced Assignments\nEngageli\u2019s self-paced materials have been enhanced to allow completion tracking and customized tasks that can be completed individually or in groups.\nMore New Features and Enhancements\n\nAccessibility\n\nUsers with the TA or instructor role can provide manual captions.\u00a0\nInstructors can manually replace transcribed captioning files. Learners with accommodation may need additional help via transcription in the Playback Room.

Once items have been set in this panel, all new classes will inherit those settings including two values that can be \u201clocked\u201d.\n\nBefore you set up Attendance Passback you must ensure that your class schedule has been assigned in the Scheduler. For more information on how to schedule your class, see this article.\n\nHow to access Classroom LMS configuration settings\n\nVisit the Admin portal (version 3.0.43+).\n\nClick Classes (Class Management in v3.0)\u00a0on the left side.\n\nIf you don\u2019t see this menu, click the 3 lines (hamburger) in the top left of the window to expand.\n\nSearch for the class you\u2019d like to adjust and select it.\n\nClick on Details and select the Live Configuration (Configuration in v3.0) tab on the right side of the window.\n\nFirst we\u2019ll set up the LMS Configuration settings which can be found in the bottom left.\n\nSelect your Session Ratio by entering or picking a value in the drop down menu.\n\nThis is a threshold (percentage) of class time that instructors are required to be logged into the class. The full duration of the class must be set via the Scheduler and this schedule is used to calculate occupancy. Once the instructor has occupied the class within the scheduled timeframe and meets the threshold, the session will be considered valid. By default, this value is set to 50%.\n\nSelect your Attendance Ratio by entering or picking a value in the drop down menu.\n\nThis is the threshold (percentage) of a session that a participant must attend to be considered present in the class. By default, this value is set to 60%.\n\nEnable or Disable Skip roster sync with LMS (by default this setting is unchecked) by checking or unchecking the box. Note: We do not recommend adjusting this setting without consulting your Solutions Engineer.\n\nRoster sync will automatically sync an entire class roster to Engageli every time an instructor logs into the class via LTI. This checkbox allows administrators to disable/enable this feature.\n\nWhen this feature is turned off, an individual user\u2019s LMS roster information will be synced each time they login via LTI.\n\nIf the person is no longer in the LMS class but present in our class roster, they will remain in the roster but be marked \u201cinactive\u201d and will NOT have access to the class.\n\nEnable or Disable Upload class attendance to LMS by checking or unchecking the box. Note: This field can be locked by an administrator to disable others to control this setting at a class level. If you are not able to adjust this setting, please reach out to your administrator.\n\nWhen enabled, this feature will upload attendance to the integrated LMS as a course grade item.\n\nOnce enabled, class attendance will be synced at regular intervals set in LTI site settings, for more information this setting please see this article. Additionally, this allows attendance to be manually synced by instructors at the class level.\n\nSet LMS attendance maximum score by picking an option from the drop down menu.\n\nThis sets the maximum attendance score possible for a participant that will be passed back to your LMS. There are two options for maximum score, 100 and 1.\n\nWhen a participant has attended the class for the entire session we will send the maximum score or a percentage depending on how it\u2019s set in the next field (LMS attendance score policy).\n\nSet LMS attendance score policy by picking an option from the drop down menu.\n\nThis sets the policy for how attendance is scored and can be set to either Pass/Fail or a Percentage. This feature works in conjunction with the maximum score to calculate attendance.\n\nPass/Fail will send either the set attendance maximum score 100 or 1 (pass) or 0 (fail). Alternatively we can send a null instead of 0 for a fail, for more information see LMS attendance no-show policy.\n\nPercentage will either send the score as a percentage based on the set attendance maximum score (0-100% or 0.00-1.00). Alternatively we can send a null instead of a failing score, for more information see LMS attendance no-show policy.\n\nSet LMS attendance no-show policy by picking an option from the drop down menu.\n\nThis sets the behavior for users who have \u2018not attended\u2019 a class. This can be set to Send Nothing (not create an entry) or Send Score (based on above settings) if a participant has not met the attendance requirements.\n\nClick Save Changes in the bottom right.\n\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n PREV\nHow to Control Closed Captions for a Class\nNEXT \nHow to customize the number of seats per table\n \n \nWas this article helpful?\nYes No\n0 out of 0 found this helpful\nHave more questions?

Before checking the rest of the configurations, use Engageli\u2019s Test Your System to ensure the permissions have been enabled for your audio and video devices. If user workstations have audio, video, and screen share system permissions locked, these will need to be allowed by an IT administrator to ensure the classroom functionality works correctly.\n\nWhat are the URLs that are used to access the Engageli platform?\u00a0\n\nIf your whitelists allow wildcards, please add *.engageli.com and *.engageli-prod.com.\n\nDo I need to open any specific network communication ports?\n\nWe use HTTPS over TCP for loading assets and the web app, and WebRTC over UDP for our video and audio streams. We also need access to STUN and TURN servers, and your Engageli representative can provide you with a connectivity test.\n\nAre there specific client side / browser settings that need to be configured?\n\nNo, browser plug-ins are not needed. When you access Engageli for the first time, you will be prompted to allow permissions for your device microphone and camera.\n\nWhat browser versions are currently supported?\n\nGoogle Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Brave on a Windows or MacOS device. The browser will require the user to access their microphone, camera, and screen sharing system permissions through their preferred or allowed browser.\u00a0\n\nHow are users authenticated on the platform, and how are they managed?\n\nFor larger deployments, we recommend an integration with your systems to provide authentication. This can either be a single-sign-on (SSO) integration with your identity provider, or an LTI 1.3 integration with a Learning Management System (LMS). The LTI 1.3 integration also provides additional capabilities around creation of Engageli classrooms and populating the roster. If you would like to talk about these options, please reach out to your Engageli representative.\n\nDoes accessing via VPN affect Engageli?\u00a0\n\nYes, we have noticed VPN connections degrade the user experience. If this is a requirement by your IT department, please let your Engageli representative know. Additionally, you can forward our IPs, Ports, and Protocols list below to your IT team to have them ensure Engageli will work with your VPN.\n\nCan Quality of Service (QoS) rules be applied to specific types of traffic?\n\nWe recommend prioritizing Engageli traffic where possible.\n\nIPs, Ports, and Protocols to whitelist\n\nIf your network requires whitelisting or exception, below is a list of IP addresses, protocols, port ranges, and domains you can share with your IT team.\n\nService\n\t\nPorts\n\t\nIP\n\nTCP (HTTPS/WSS)\t443\t\n\n*.engageli.com\n\n*.engageli-prod.com\n\n\n\n\nUDP (WebRTC)\n\n\t\n\n5000-65000\n\n\tDynamic IPs provisioned from AWS.

This will help our system know when the class is scheduled to happen. Once you've set the schedule, you should see new sessions listed. For more information on how attendance is calculated, see this article.\n\nTo view the details of an individual session, click the row associated with the start and end time you'd like to learn more about. Once you do this, it will open in the Gradebook Sync tab.\n\nGradebook Sync\n\nThis tab contains details of an individual session and includes settings that control what and how we pass attendance data back to your learning management system as well as a button to manually sync data to your LMS.\n\nThe following settings are typically set by your Engageli administrator.\u00a0\n\nLMS attendance maximum score\n\nThis sets the maximum attendance score possible for a participant. This can be set to a number between 1000000 and 1.\n\nWhen a participant has attended the class for the entire session or enough to be counted as present we will send the maximum score or a percentage depending on how it\u2019s set in the next field (LMS attendance score policy).\n\nLMS attendance score policy by picking an option from the drop down menu.\n\nThis sets the policy for how attendance is scored and can be set to either Pass/Fail or a Percentage. This feature works in conjunction with the maximum score to calculate attendance.\n\nPass/Fail will send either the set attendance maximum score 100000-1 (pass) or 0 (fail). Alternatively we can send a null instead of 0 for a fail, for more information see LMS attendance no-show policy.\n\nPercentage will either send the score as a percentage based on the set attendance maximum score (0-100% or 0.00-1.00). Alternatively we can send a null instead of a failing score, for more information see LMS attendance no-show policy.\n\nLMS attendance no-show policy\u00a0\n\nThis sets the behavior for users who have \u2018not attended\u2019 a class. This can be set to Send Nothing (not create an entry) or Send Score (based on above settings) has not met the attendance requirements.\n\nSession Ratio\n\nThis is a threshold (percentage) of class time that instructors are required to be logged into the class. The full duration of the class must be set via the Scheduler and this schedule is used to calculate occupancy. Once the instructor has occupied the class within the scheduled timeframe and meets the threshold, the session will be considered valid. By default, this value is set to 50%.\n\nFor example, if the Scheduler is set to 7 pm to 9 pm EST i.e. 120 minutes every Monday. If session ratio is set to 50%, that indicates the instructor should have been in class for 50% of the 120 minutes\n\nAttendance Ratio\n\nThis is the threshold (percentage) of a session that a participant must attend to be considered present in the class.

Check your internet connection\u00a0\n\nOther computers/devices using the same network can cause the network to slow down, which can result in audio and video issues.\u00a0\n\n2. Switch to low bandwidth mode\n\nClick the three dots menu at the bottom of your screen, and then click Low bandwidth mode. This mode will save bandwidth by automatically merging the gallery view into one video feed and turning off learner video feeds when they are on the podium and in the table mates gallery when you visit individual tables. You will still hear each learner\u2019s audio.\n\n3. Mute your audio\n\nYour audio doesn\u2019t use as much bandwidth as your video, but you can reduce your bandwidth by muting your audio when you\u2019re not speaking, there\u2019s a panel discussion, or when learners doing group activities.\n\n4. Turn off your video\n\nWhen showing video clips or when learners are engaged in peer-to-peer and group activities, turn off your video feed to lower your computer\u2019s CPU usage and improve network traffic.\u00a0\n\n5. Screen share only when necessary\n\nMake sure to stop sharing when you no longer need to show a tab, window, or your screen. You can upload slides or a presentation to the chat for learners to view on their own devices.\n\n6. Close other applications\n\nTo free up more network resources, close other applications and programs you do not need during your Engageli session.\u00a0\n\n\n\u00a0\n\nFor optimal performance with Engageli, we recommend keeping your operating system and browsers up to date.

Instructors can use this data to track engagement during their sessions and answer questions such as:\n\nWhich learners are participating in the session (and which are not)?\nAm I, as the instructor, actively involving my learners in the session by asking questions, soliciting feedback, and asking them to share?\n\nChat Analytics\n\nChats can make virtual learning more efficient as questions are answered in real-time in context with instruction. Chat messages increase opportunities for learner-to-learner collaboration, as well as learner-to-instructor interaction. Chat also allows learners who are not able to turn on their microphone or camera to still actively participate in class by sending messages, uploading materials, collaborating with their tablemates, and engaging in community-building or other learning activities.\n\nA classroom with a larger percentage of messages sent to tablemates rather than private, 1-on-1 messages could reflect strong collaboration among the learners.\n\nPoll Analytics\n\nPolls can be presented in the course material as checks for comprehension and engagement in real-time. Using polls provides instructors an opportunity to adjust the pace of the class and can foster a discussion about the results in an effort to make the material more understandable. Polls also allow learners who are not able to turn on their microphone or camera to participate in checks for understanding or community-building polls, which can be used to determine learning gains, engagement, and if individual attention is required.\n\nPoll participation can indicate learner sentiment about instructional pedagogies used during the class.\n\nSpeak Time Analytics\n\nSpeak time is an important element of learning. Not only does talking help learners process the information presented during a lesson, it also promotes peer-to-peer learning and builds connections and community. Opportunities for table discussion (private to the table and never recorded) provide learners psychological safety and time to reflect and collaborate on the concepts presented. Interlacing class time with group activities at tables can provide structured ways for learners to practice critical thinking and reflect on the content presented.\n\nMeasuring learner speak time helps instructors understand the participation equity of learners in the class. It can also help instructors redesign their class session plans by incorporating additional time for group activities to increase speaking time and overall engagement in the classroom.\n\nReviewing the total learner speaking time vs instructor speaking time can help determine the proportion of direct instruction during a class.\n\nAttendance Analytics\n\nResearch shows that attendance is an important factor in learner achievement, as learners are more likely to succeed in academics when they attend class sessions consistently and are exposed to instruction.\n\nAttendance data can also be used to identify learners who are not attending and potentially falling behind, or who might need a success coach to reach out to ensure retention. Playback Room attendance data can be used to track whether absent or asynchronous learners review class recordings and engage with the course material and if follow-up attention is needed.\n\nGrades\n\nGrades allow instructors to evaluate learners and provide feedback on their work and performance.\n\nGrades recorded in Engageli can be used to identify learners who are falling behind, are having trouble with retention, or need individual support, supplemental instruction, or tutoring.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0Need more help?

This is applicable only to single-answer polls.\n\nWhen to use:\n\nIf most learners answer the same question correctly, it may not be worth the class time to discuss the results. If learners are split in their responses, invite them to discuss with other learners to probe for differences and clarify misconceptions. Use this feature to divide the learners into small groups. (You can even re-run the poll after learners discuss their responses with peers.)\nSplitting learners into table groups based on similar poll results can be a good way to help learners get to know each other during icebreakers, share a common interest, prepare group responses to discussion questions, group learners for projects based on topic interest or prepare for debates conducted via a Panel Discussion.\n\nSplit learners based on poll results during the poll:\n\nInstructions\n\nRun the poll in your shared presentation or PDF.\nClick Start Poll Split.\nSelect whether you want to split learners by Diverse or Common responses.\nUse the slider to the maximum number of learners you want at each table. (TAs won\u2019t be moved to a different table.)\nUse the slider to choose the number of learners per table.\nIf you want to reserve [skip in Engageli 3.0] or set aside certain tables, use the slider to select the tables.\nClick Split [Confirm in Engageli 3.0].\n\nLearners can be split into groups of 1-10 learners, depending on the number of seats at each table. Click here to learn how to change the number of seats at a table. Click here to learn more about skipping tables during the split-by-poll arrangement.\n\nNote: In situations where learners do not answer the poll question, they are considered as if the poll has an additional answer possibility (i.e., \u201cdid not want to answer\u201d), and will be split into table groups based on dissimilar responses.\n\nYou can also split learners based on poll results at any point during the class from the Tables Tab.

You can now easily skip or set aside tables during these table arrangements.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe number of tables to skip corresponds to the first nine tables in the classroom, left to right. If you choose to skip 1 table, no learners will be assigned to Table 1. If you choose to skip 2 tables, no learners will be assigned to Table 1 or Table 2. All users (learners, TAs, and instructors) can take part in polls, but TAs won\u2019t be re-arranged when you use the \u201cSplit Learners by Poll Results\u201d feature. If they are placed at a skipped table, they will remain at the table, but no other learners will be assigned to that table.\n\nInstructions\n\nRun the poll in your shared presentation or PDF. (Note: Splitting learners based on poll results is applicable only for single-answer polls.)\nClick\u00a0Start Poll Split.\nSelect whether you want to split learners by\u00a0Diverse\u00a0or\u00a0Common\u00a0responses.\nUse the slider to the maximum number of learners you want at each table. (TAs won\u2019t be moved to a different table.)\nUse the slider to choose the number of learners per table.\nIf you want to reserve [skip in Engageli 3.0] or set aside certain tables, use the slider to select up to the first 3 tables.\nClick Split [Confirm in Engageli 3.0].\n\nWhen to use:\nWhen you have support individuals, such as teaching assistants, administrative staff, or mentors who will not take part in table activities based on poll results\nWhen you have a dedicated support table, with individuals who you\u2019d like to place at that table to assist learners\u00a0\nWhen you have someone observing your teaching and you\u2019d like to place them at a set table so you can join and discuss their observations while learners work in their table groups\nWhen you have guests who you would like to place at one table so you can join the table and discuss the poll results or other content while learners work in their table groups\nWhen you have guests who you would like to place at one table so you can easily add them to a panel or ask them to join the podium\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0Need more help?

Engageli\u2019s Chat feature allows instructors to communicate directly with learners, and learners to communicate directly with each other. Here are some tips for managing the chat so you can foster communication and engagement and conduct your Engageli session with ease.\n\n1. Learn your chat channels\n\nEveryone - All participants in the class\n\nStaff - All instructors and TAs in the class\n\nTAs - All users logged in as TAs\n\nLearner\u00a0name - Specific learner\n\nTable \u2013 If you change the table names, you will see the customized table names in the chat channels menu.\n\n2. Set ground rules\n\nLearners might use the chat to carry on discussions unrelated to the class session. Establish ground rules a the beginning of the session if you have rules you want the learners to follow such as keeping side conversations to a minimum or not overusing emojis, acronyms, shorthand, etc.\n\n3. Post Questions in the Q&A\n\nIf you have questions for your learners that you don\u2019t want to get lost in the chat, you can post them in the Q&A. The Q&A is threaded, persists, and asynchronous learners watching the class recording in the Playback Room will also be able to participate. Like the chat, the Q&A can be downloaded.\n\n4. Designate a Moderator\n\nIf you have teaching assistants (TA), you can assign them or another learner to be the moderator and keep track of the chat. The chat moderator can answer questions without distracting from a presentation or lecture and also alert you to pertinent questions or comments via a private chat to you or the \u201cStaff\u201d channel.\n\n5. Download the chat for later review\n\nDuring a session, learners may actively participate in the chat, posting questions, responding, and helping each other. If you are not able to keep up with the chat in real-time, you can download the chat at the end of class for later review so that you can address any outstanding questions or issues in the next class.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0Need more help?

If you do not want to appear in a large view in the recording, then you should continue to share your screen.\n\nLearner Video\n\nLearners' video feeds in the Class Gallery under My View are\u00a0not\u00a0recorded\u00a0by default\u00a0for privacy reasons.\u00a0You can enable the recording of the Class Gallery in the Admin Portal.\u00a0Click here to learn how class recordings can be configured to include or exclude your learners\u2019 video feeds or the Class Gallery [Engageli 3.1 only].\n\nLearner Audio\n\nIn Room Mode, which is the Engageli default, learners will be recorded regardless of whether they raise their hands or not. Room Mode captures all audio in the classroom.\u00a0\nDiscussions that happen at the tables when Table Mode is enabled are not recorded.\n\nTables and Group Activities\u00a0\n\nIf you are doing group activities, and are visiting tables, the recording will not pause automatically. If you are conducting group activities within the tables, you should pause the recording until you regroup so that there is no blank air time.\u00a0\n\nCollaborative Features\n\nIf you run a poll during your class, as an ice breaker or to check for understanding, learners watching the recording can also participate in the poll. After you turn on the poll, the poll will be displayed in the recording. If you want asynchronous learners to see the live results, click \"Share Results\" in the live session. Asynchronous learners will need to answer the poll before seeing the live results.\nAny questions posted in the Q&A during the live class will be displayed in the Playback Room. Learners watching the recording can answer the same questions that were posed in the live session. The questions will appear to any learner who attended, whether during the live session or viewing the recording in the Playback Room.\nMessages sent in the Chat are not included in the recording and do not persist in the Playback room.\nIf you distribute a Class or Table Whiteboard to learners during the session, these will be included in the recording. We recommend instructing asynchronous learners to replicate any whiteboard activities done in the live class, as the host can open a whiteboard in the Playback Room.\n\nNew in Engageli 3.1!\n\nIn Engageli 3.1, instructors can change their settings to include the Class Gallery in recordings. Table whiteboards are also included in the class recording when viewed in an Engageli Playback Room.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0Need more help?

You can have the same file open or different files for different tables.\n\nWhen to use: You can use this feature to distribute a file to learners to collaborate in real-time on table-based activities, peer-to-peer instruction, station-based work, case studies per table, etc. You can distribute:\nOne document shared with all tables\nIndividual documents shared per table\n\nFor either a class document or separate table documents, you can share the following types of files:\n\nGoogle Document, Sheet, and Slides\nMicrosoft 365 Word, Excel, and Powerpoint\n\nNote: Microsoft 365 files open within Engageli in view-only mode.

Check your internet connection\u00a0\n\nOther computers/devices using the same network can cause the network to slow down, which can result in audio and video issues.\u00a0\n\n2. Switch to Low bandwidth mode\n\nClick the More Actions (three dots) menu at the bottom of your screen, and then click Low bandwidth mode. This mode will save bandwidth by automatically turning off the video feeds of other learners at your table and when learners raise their hands at the podium. Video feeds in the gallery will still be visible in a merged view. The merged gallery view will save bandwidth by merging the gallery into one video feed for all learners instead of having individual video feeds for each learner.\n\n3. Turn off your video\n\nTurning off your video feed is an easy way to lower your computer\u2019s CPU usage and improve network traffic. If needed, discuss with your instructor beforehand, but start your video only when you have to or leave it off for the duration of your class session.\n\n4. Mute your audio\n\nYour audio doesn\u2019t use as much bandwidth as your video, but you can reduce your bandwidth by muting your audio when you\u2019re not speaking.\u00a0\n\n5. Close other applications\n\nTo free up more network resources, close other applications and programs you do not need during your Engageli session.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nFor optimal performance with Engageli, we recommend keeping your operating system and browsers up to date. You may have trouble using certain features on Engageli if you are joining your virtual classroom in parallel with CPU- intensive applications such as cloud computing and streaming services.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0Need more help?

You can now easily skip or set aside tables during these table arrangements.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe number of tables to skip corresponds to the first nine tables in the classroom, left to right. If you choose to skip 1 table, no learners will be assigned to Table 1. If you choose to skip 2 tables, no learners will be assigned to Table 1 or Table 2. All users (learners, TAs, and instructors) can take part in polls, but TAs won\u2019t be re-arranged when you use the \u201cSplit Learners by Poll Results\u201d feature. If they are placed at a skipped table, they will remain at the table, but no other learners will be assigned to that table.\n\nInstructions\n\nRun the poll in your shared presentation or PDF. (Note: Splitting learners based on poll results is applicable only for single-answer polls.)\nClick\u00a0Start Poll Split.\nSelect whether you want to split learners by\u00a0Diverse\u00a0or\u00a0Common\u00a0responses.\nUse the slider to the maximum number of learners you want at each table.

This allows you to easily \u2018move\u2019 learners into different pre-assigned groups without having to use class time to create them.\n\nInstructions\n\nGo to the Admin Portal.\nClick Class Management from\u00a0the menu on the Left.\nSelect your class from the list of Active Classes or use the search field to find your class.\n\nClick the class name.\nSelect Tables & Presets from the menu on the left.\nClick the Tables tab to add custom names for each table, if desired.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\nClick the Presets tab to create or upload a preset.\u00a0\nClick View a sample/CSV template here to open the template as a Google Document.\u00a0 \nChoose File > Make a copy. You can name this copy whatever you like.\nAdd each learner\u2019s email and the table you want them added to upon joining. In this example, we have placed three students in each project group. Upon login, they will automatically be placed at Project Group 1 table and Project Group 2 table. Please note: The tables in your .cvs file must match the names of the tables you created in step 6. If you did not rename tables, use the default table names: Table 1, Table 2, Table 3, etc. \nWhen finished, go to File > Download > Comma-separated values (.csv, current sheet) to save the file to your computer.\nClick Upload Preset.\nName the preset and add a description if helpful (ex: Group Activity - Use this preset when you start group activity).\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\nUpload the preset by clicking Files, and then Add.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\nOnce presets have been uploaded, you will see a learner\u2019s assigned location for each preset saved next to their name in the Roster tab in the portal.\u00a0\n\nNote: Without presets, you can still assign learners to randomly-combined groups of select sizes (1-10 learners) at any time.

Go to the Apple icon in the top left corner of your screen.\n\n2. Select System Settings.\n\n3. Select Privacy & Security.\n\n4.

Click here for instructions to resolve screen sharing issues using the Engageli instructor application on a Mac.\u00a0\n\nIf screen sharing issues persist, please see steps below.\u00a0\n\nCheck Sharing Settings\n\nInstructions\n\n1. To check your Sharing settings, go to the Apple icon in the top left corner of your screen.\n\n2. Select System Settings from the drop-down menu.\n\n3. Search for and select Screen Sharing.\n\n4. Check the box for Screen Sharing if it is not already checked.\u00a0\n\nNote: If the box for Remote Management is checked, you might not be able to share your entire screen on Engageli, and will need to contact an Administrator at your institution. However, you will be able to share browser tabs.\n\nYou should now be able to share your screen with the class, but if you are still having trouble you should answer the following questions:\u00a0\n\nWhat device are you using? We currently do not support mobile or tablet devices. If a user is on one of these, instruct them to join via laptop, computer, or Chromebook.\nWhat browser are you using? We currently do not recommend Safari or Firefox browsers. If a user is on one of these, invite them to join Engageli via Chrome, Edge, or a browser on Chromium (Opera, Vivaldi, Brave).\nHave you tried refreshing the browser? If not, instruct the user to refresh the browser (log out and log back in). Simply taking this action can sometimes solve your problem.\u00a0\nDo you have an extension running that is blocking screen sharing? Check your extensions or 3rd party anti-virus software.\nDid your permissions get reset? Sometimes permissions are reset without any notification, so recheck your settings to make sure Engageli has permission to share and record your screen.\n\nIf none of this works, reach out to our Support team.\n\nYou can also use the PDF Live Share to share a presentation directly in Engageli without sharing your screen.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0Need more help?

Click to understand more about Room Mode and Table Mode and how to effectively use Engageli's audio modes to foster active learning and collaboration.\u00a0\n\nEngageli now has two main audio modes, Room Mode and Table Mode.\n\nRoom Mode:\n\nThis is the default when you enter your Engageli classroom. This means that as the instructor you will hear the audio feeds from all learners, and they will hear each other, regardless of where they are seated.\n\nWhen to use: the beginning of class, or entire classroom discussions\n\n\u00a0\n\nTable Mode:\n\nWhen you enable Table Mode, learners will hear only their table mates and you will only hear learners who raise their hands.\u00a0\n\nWhen to use: small group discussions, projects, and other table activities\n\n\u00a0\n\nYou can easily toggle between the two modes from the bottom right corner of the screen.\n\n\u00a0 \n\nIf you or a co-instructor join a table, Engageli automatically switches to Table Mode. When at a table, you will only hear the learners at that table (and any learners at other tables that raise their hands).\u00a0 While an instructor is at a table, no instructor will be able to change the mode to Room Mode.\u00a0\n\nFor learners, the tablemates panel will automatically close when switching the audio mode to Room mode from the Table audio mode so learners direct their attention back to the class.\n\nIf you would like to hear all the learners concurrently while at the podium in Table Mode, click on the three dots and choose \u2018Hear tables while on podium in table mode\u2019.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nYou can hover over the Table Mode and Room Mode buttons to see who you can hear and who can hear you.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: All audio will be recorded in Room Mode and only those on podium (learners with hands raised or instructor(s)) will be recorded in Table Mode.\n\n\u00a0\n\nClick to learn how to add a tag to your presentation for a reminder to switch between Room Mode and Table Mode.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0Need more help?

{"url": "https://support.engageli.com/hc/en-us/articles/8562644617627-How-to-Track-Learner-Engagement-During-Class", "html": "How to Track Learner Engagement During Class\n1 month ago Updated\nFollow\nNot yet followed by anyone\n\nThere are many ways to track engagement in Engageli. These markers can help you keep a pulse on how the class is engaging with and learning the content so you can adjust as needed.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIndividual Engagement Markers\n\n1. Thumbs up/thumbs down\n\nYou can ask learners to use the reactions to give you a thumbs up or down. Everyone will see the thumbs appear instantly on the screen, but only instructors and TAs will see individual thumbs up/thumbs down on the learners' video feeds in the Class Gallery.\n\nThumbs up or down can be used to get quick feedback, check understanding, or check if learners are paying attention. Some example questions to use with thumbs are:\n\n\"Do you understand the material we just covered?\"\n\"Give me a thumbs up if you can see my screen.\"\n\nPro Tip! Use thumbs up or down to check engagement for learners with their cameras off. When coming back after a break, if many learners turned off their cameras, ask for a thumbs up if learners are back and then look at the class gallery to see how many thumbs up there are.\n\nThere are additional reactions and sounds for learners and instructors. Click here to learn more.\u00a0\n\n2. Green Dot Marker\n\nEach learner has an engagement marker in the bottom right corner of their video feed in the Class Gallery.\n\nThe green dot marker represents when a learner is \"active,\" meaning that they have recently interacted in the classroom in some way. The green dot resets to the maximum size (5) each time a learner does one of the following:\n\nWrites a question or answer in Q&A\nResponds to a poll question\nRaises hand\nLowers hand\nShares screen with their table\nShares screen with their class\nUses thumbs up/down\nUses other emojis reactions\nSends a chat message (private chats are not included)\nInitiates audio activity (speaking, unmuting microphone)\n\nNote: The green marker decays and appears smaller after some time. The decay is linear, from maximum (5) to minimum (0) over three minutes. Hovering over the indicator in a learner\u2019s video feed shows an engagement value out of 5 (Engagement - 5/5). Any form of activity listed above will turn the marker green.\n\nThe gray dot marker replaces the green markers when a learner who was previously active has not recently interacted in the classroom. In general, a green marker will turn gray after three minutes. The gray marker corresponds to an Engagement rating of 0/5.\n\nNo marker simply means the learner has not interacted in the classroom at any point.\n\nThe perforated (dotted) marker indicates that a learner who was seated at a table has left the class. They are still represented in the class by what's called a reservation, as explained in this article.\n\nYou can also see the green dot marker next to the learner's name in the List view in the Tables tab.\n\n\u00a0\n\nTable Engagement\n\nIn addition to the learner\u2019s video feed and the Lists view, the individual engagement markers trigger an engagement indication at the table level, which you can see in the Tables tab at the top of the screen.\n\nSimilar to the green dot marker, the green table ring decays and fades away after some time due to inactivity. The decay is linear, from maximum (5) to minimum (0) over three minutes.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0Need more help?

Based on feedback from partners, we've redesigned the Engageli classroom to better support teaching and active learning and provide a flexible learning environment for all participants. In addition to a variety of new features, Engageli\u2019s team has enhanced the overall teaching and learning experience in many ways.\u00a0\n\nNew Features\n\nAccessibility\n\nDeaf and hard-of-hearing users can now learn with a dedicated sign language interpreter. Users can overlay the interpreter\u2019s video over their classroom windows and customize the size and placement of the video at any time.\u00a0\n\nAsynchronous Experience\n\nInstructors can now customize the asynchronous experience. They can upload external videos to be viewed in an Engageli Playback Room, or upload PDFs for learners to access. They can also edit and trim class recordings to share the best version of the class with learners.\u00a0\n\nChat, Notes, Q&A\n\nThe new and improved chat allows users to filter and search for chat messages for better ease of use. Browser users can take and annotate screenshots in the chat and reply and add reactions (thumbs, hearts, etc.) to messages.\n\nIn-class Teaching Tools\n\nThe Distributed Docs feature has been enhanced to include Google Sheets and Slides and Microsoft 365 Word, Excel, and Powerpoint files. Instructors can share a file for class-wide collaboration as well as add and edit shared files during the class session, instead of preloading in the Admin Portal.\u00a0\nNew emojis and sounds have been added as reactions to enable users to give clear and immediate feedback. Instructors can customize the settings for the reactions.\n\nAdmin Portal\n\nThe Admin Portal has been updated with new classroom filters and search capabilities, automatically enabled classroom guest links, and a calendar invitation option that makes setting up classes easier. Instructors and admins can now filter the Chat, Poll, Speak Time, and Hand Raise analytics by date range.\u00a0\n\nPlease select an accordion to learn about Engageli 3.0 Enhancements and Resolved Issues.\u00a0\n\nEnhancements\nResolved Issues\n\n\u00a0Need more help?

Engageli 3.1 users have several options for returning to the podium.\n\nNote: The audio will automatically switch from Room Mode to Table Mode. When you leave the table, you will have to switch the audio setting back to Room Mode to enable a full-class discussion. Click to learn more about the audio settings.\n\nNew in Engageli 3.1!\n\nIn Engageli 3.1, instructors will peek at or observe tables unobtrusively without disturbing the learners.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nCreating Random Tables Groups\u00a0\n\nThis is a great way to encourage learner engagement is to randomly arrange table groups for discussions.\u00a0\n\nInstructions\n\n1. Go to the Seating Arrangement drop-down menu in the Tables view.\u00a0\n\n2. Select Random Arrangement Table Size.\n\n3. Choose the number of learners you would like at each table. The system will automatically break learners into randomized groups.\n\nYou can also reserve any of the first 3 tables for staff or other participants who you don't want to move during the random arrangement. In Engageli 3.0, this is called Skip Tables.\n\nNote: If learners have a reservation, then they will be treated as learners. Make sure to remove any reservations before you do this! (See instructions on reservations here).\n\nYou can save the table arrangement you created as a preset that you can use again. Click for information on how to create a table preset during a class.\n\n\u00a0\n\nMoving Learners to Different Tables\u00a0\n\nInstructions\n1. Navigate to the Tables view.\n2. Click the profile icon of the learner you wish to move.\n\n3. Choose a new table for the learner from the drop-down menu.\n\n4. Or, you can simply drag and drop the learner to a different table.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0Need more help?

Room Mode captures all audio in the classroom.\u00a0\nDiscussions that happen at the tables when Table Mode is enabled are not recorded.\n\nTables and Group Activities\u00a0\n\nIf you are doing group activities, and are visiting tables, the recording will not pause automatically. If you are conducting group activities within the tables, you should pause the recording until you regroup so that there is no blank air time.\u00a0\n\nCollaborative Features\n\nIf you run a poll during your class, as an ice breaker or to check for understanding, learners watching the recording can also participate in the poll. After you turn on the poll, the poll will be displayed in the recording. If you want asynchronous learners to see the live results, click \"Share Results\" in the live session. Asynchronous learners will need to answer the poll before seeing the live results.\nAny questions posted in the Q&A during the live class will be displayed in the Playback Room. Learners watching the recording can answer the same questions that were posed in the live session. The questions will appear to any learner who attended, whether during the live session or viewing the recording in the Playback Room.\nMessages sent in the Chat are not included in the recording and do not persist in the Playback room.\nIf you distribute a Class or Table Whiteboard to learners during the session, these will be included in the recording. We recommend instructing asynchronous learners to replicate any whiteboard activities done in the live class, as the host can open a whiteboard in the Playback Room.\n\nNew in Engageli 3.1!\n\nIn Engageli 3.1, instructors can change their settings to include the Class Gallery in recordings. Table whiteboards are also included in the class recording when viewed in an Engageli Playback Room.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0Need more help?

{"url": "https://support.engageli.com/hc/en-us/articles/8386334474011-How-to-Manage-the-Chat", "html": "How to Manage the Chat\n5 months ago Updated\nFollow\nNot yet followed by anyone\n\nInstructors in virtual classrooms have to balance presenting their educational material, navigating the features of the platform as well as holding their learners' attention and keeping them engaged. Engageli\u2019s Chat feature allows instructors to communicate directly with learners, and learners to communicate directly with each other. Here are some tips for managing the chat so you can foster communication and engagement and conduct your Engageli session with ease.\n\n1. Learn your chat channels\n\nEveryone - All participants in the class\n\nStaff - All instructors and TAs in the class\n\nTAs - All users logged in as TAs\n\nLearner\u00a0name - Specific learner\n\nTable \u2013 If you change the table names, you will see the customized table names in the chat channels menu.\n\n2. Set ground rules\n\nLearners might use the chat to carry on discussions unrelated to the class session. Establish ground rules a the beginning of the session if you have rules you want the learners to follow such as keeping side conversations to a minimum or not overusing emojis, acronyms, shorthand, etc.\n\n3. Post Questions in the Q&A\n\nIf you have questions for your learners that you don\u2019t want to get lost in the chat, you can post them in the Q&A. The Q&A is threaded, persists, and asynchronous learners watching the class recording in the Playback Room will also be able to participate. Like the chat, the Q&A can be downloaded.\n\n4. Designate a Moderator\n\nIf you have teaching assistants (TA), you can assign them or another learner to be the moderator and keep track of the chat. The chat moderator can answer questions without distracting from a presentation or lecture and also alert you to pertinent questions or comments via a private chat to you or the \u201cStaff\u201d channel.\n\n5. Download the chat for later review\n\nDuring a session, learners may actively participate in the chat, posting questions, responding, and helping each other. If you are not able to keep up with the chat in real-time, you can download the chat at the end of class for later review so that you can address any outstanding questions or issues in the next class.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0Need more help?

Tables are built so learners will always be in small groups and you do not need to create breakout rooms for group activities. This allows you to create rich learning experiences at the tables while learners also feel simultaneously connected to the larger class and the instructor.\n\n\u00a0\n\nJoining Tables\n\nCreating Random Tables Groups\u00a0\n\nMoving learners to different Tables\n\n\u00a0\n\nJoining Tables\n\nJoining tables allows you to leave the podium and \u201cvisit\u201d groups of learners at tables, much like \u201cwalking the room\u201d in an in-person class. This is great for any group work or discussions.\n\nInstructions\n1. To join a table, click the Tables tab.\n2. Hover over the table that you'd like to join and click the JOIN button.\n\nWhen you join the table, you will see, hear, and interact only with members of the table you joined. This is great when groups have a question on an in-class assignment and you don't want to interrupt the entire class.\n\n3. When you are ready to leave the table, click the Back to podium button. Engageli 3.1 users have several options for returning to the podium.\n\nNote: The audio will automatically switch from Room Mode to Table Mode. When you leave the table, you will have to switch the audio setting back to Room Mode to enable a full-class discussion. Click to learn more about the audio settings.\n\nNew in Engageli 3.1!\n\nIn Engageli 3.1, instructors will peek at or observe tables unobtrusively without disturbing the learners.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nCreating Random Tables Groups\u00a0\n\nThis is a great way to encourage learner engagement is to randomly arrange table groups for discussions.\u00a0\n\nInstructions\n\n1. Go to the Seating Arrangement drop-down menu in the Tables view.\u00a0\n\n2. Select Random Arrangement Table Size.\n\n3. Choose the number of learners you would like at each table. The system will automatically break learners into randomized groups.\n\nYou can also reserve any of the first 3 tables for staff or other participants who you don't want to move during the random arrangement. In Engageli 3.0, this is called Skip Tables.\n\nNote: If learners have a reservation, then they will be treated as learners. Make sure to remove any reservations before you do this! (See instructions on reservations here).\n\nYou can save the table arrangement you created as a preset that you can use again. Click for information on how to create a table preset during a class.\n\n\u00a0\n\nMoving Learners to Different Tables\u00a0\n\nInstructions\n1. Navigate to the Tables view.\n2. Click the profile icon of the learner you wish to move.\n\n3. Choose a new table for the learner from the drop-down menu.\n\n4. Or, you can simply drag and drop the learner to a different table.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0Need more help?

Instructors can use the Q&A feature as part of a live, hybrid/blended, or asynchronous teaching strategy to allow learners to complete activities, interact with others and provide or receive feedback during class or on their own time. Below are some quick tips for how to use the Q&A feature in your Engageli classroom.\n\n\u00a0\n\nDuring Class\n\nIcebreakers\n\nPost a fun icebreaker question in the Q&A. This provides an early opportunity for learners to get comfortable sharing and participating in a low-stakes way, building their confidence in the safety and community of the classroom, and finding connections with other learners.\n\nDiscussion Prompts\n\nYou can post a question in the Q&A section related to the topic you plan to discuss in class. Ask learners to post answers about readings or assignments in the Q&A when they join the class.\nSplit the class into small groups, set the timer, and ask learners to discuss their answers with their tablemates to facilitate knowledge sharing.\n\nEncourage Learner Questions\n\nEncourage learners to post questions in the Q&A, and respond to questions posted by their classmates. Anonymous mode encourages participation by allowing learners who are hesitant or shy to post their responses unattributed.*\n\nProvide Clear and Detailed Instructions\n\nUse the Q&A to post detailed activity instructions for individual and group activities.\n\n\u00a0\n\nPlayback Rooms\n\nPeer-to-Peer Post-Class Learning\n\nLearners can join a Playback Room to review the class recording and discuss a prompt posted in the Q&A. Learners can add questions and responses in the Q&A for the instructor to later review.\nInstructors can direct learners to review a specific class recording that includes an in-class poll. Have the learners pause the video to discuss their responses to the poll question and summarize the group\u2019s findings in the Q&A.\n\nFlipped Classrooms\n\nInstructors can use a Playback Room for flipped classroom instruction:\nLearners can create study hall groups to engage with foundational material in the class recordings or posted in the Q&A to benefit from peer-to-peer learning.\n\nGroup Project Work\n\nLearners can work on group projects. The whiteboard and chat thread can be downloaded, and links to reference materials can be shared in the Q&A.\n\nCommunity-building Learning Activities and Collaborative Interaction\n\nThe Q&A is persistent and present in the live class and the Playback Room. Asynchronous learners can answer the same questions posed in the live session.\n\n\u00a0\n\n*Samson, P. J. (2017, December). Anonymity In Survey Courses as a Tool for More Diverse Engagement.

As the tables fill with learners, more tables are added automatically. However, you can manually add tables 5 at a time with no more than 40 recommended.\n\nInstructions\n\n1. Navigate to the Tables view.\n\n2. Click the Actions menu.\n\n3. Select Add 5 tables.\n\nNOTE: At this time, you cannot remove tables that have been added to the classroom.\n\n\u00a0\nRename Tables\n\nYou can easily rename the tables in your Engageli classroom. Table names can mirror the instructional model and range from project group names, book characters, or course topics to fun names based on hobbies or interests.\n\nInstructions\n\nDuring Class\n\n1. Go to the TABLES view.\n\n2. Hover over the table you want to rename.\n\n3. Click the existing name of the table.\n\n4. Enter the new name.\n\n5. Click the table to save the change.\n\n6. You will see a confirmation notification at the top of the screen.\n\nNote: The new table names will be saved and persist in the Admin Portal and the next time you log into the classroom.\n\nAdmin Portal\n\n1. Go to the Admin Portal.\n\n2. Click Class Management\u00a0on the left to expand the menu.\u00a0\n\n3. Select your class or use the search field to find your class.\u00a0\n\n4.

You will see a confirmation notification at the bottom of the screen.\n\n\u00a0\n\nChange the Number of Seats at Tables\n\nBy default, an Engageli classroom opens with the maximum number of seats allowed at a table: 10. As an instructor, you can easily change the number of seats at a table.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nEngageli classroom with 10 seats per table\n\n\u00a0\n\nInstructions\n\n1. Click the gear icon to open the settings.\n\n2. Select Classroom Configuration.\n\n3. Use the slider to select the number of seats for the tables.\n\n4. Click the Close button. The changes will be applied immediately.\n\nPro Tip! When deciding the number of seats, keep in mind that if you have multiple TAs who will visit tables, an available empty seat will be needed. Instructors, co-instructors, and one TA can visit tables without needing an empty seat.\n\nEngageli classroom with 5 seats per table\n\n\u00a0\n\nRemove Table Reservations\n\nTable reservations ensure that a learner can keep their spot at a table should they lose their internet connection and get logged out of the classroom. When the learner re-joins the classroom, they will automatically be placed at the same table as before. Because of having an assigned seat at the table, a table of seven present learners and three reserved is considered full.\n\nYou may want to remove table reservations to free up space at certain tables or create random table groups without including reservations in the count.\n\nWithin Tables view, you can see all reservations represented by a dotted line around a learner\u2019s profile icon.\n\n\u00a0\n\nInstructions\n\n1. Go to the TABLES view.\n\n2. In the drop-down menu Action, select Remove All Reservations.\u00a0\n\n3. You can remove an individual reservation by clicking on the learner's icon at the table and then removing it.\u00a0\n\nNote: Individual reservations will be automatically removed after 5 minutes of inactivity.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0Need more help?

When you finish all the tasks, the assignment will be marked complete.\n\nPlayback Room Asynchronous Attendance\u00a0\n\nEngageli measures the percentage of class session time a participant attended each class session, whether synchronously or asynchronously in an Engageli Playback Room. Participants can receive attendance credit for watching class recordings in the Playback Room.\u00a0\n\nUse Cases: Using Playback Rooms\u00a0\n\nPeer-to-Peer Post-Class Learning\n\nLearners can join a Playback Room to review the class recording and discuss a prompt posted in the Q&A tab. Learners can add questions and responses in the Q&A for the instructor to later review.\nInstructors can direct learners to review a specific class recording that includes an in-class poll. Have the learners pause the video to discuss their responses to the poll question and summarize the group\u2019s findings in the Q&A.\n\nFlipped Classrooms\n\nInstructors can use a Playback Room for flipped classroom instruction:\nLearners can create study hall groups to engage with foundational material in the class recordings or posted in the Q&A to benefit from peer-to-peer learning.\nThey can also establish a foundation of key concepts before attending live sessions through interactive learning activities instructor-led group work and in-depth application of the subject matter.\n\n\nTutoring / Supplemental Instruction\n\nTAs or a group leader can create a study hall session for tutoring/supplemental instruction, group office hour sessions, and exam preparation.\n\nGroup Project Work\n\nLearners can work on group projects.

However, if we are not integrated with your institution\u2019s LMS or you want to use specific seating assignments during class, you will need to have a list of learners in the system.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nSetting Up Class Roster\n\n1. Navigate to the Engageli portal and find your classroom.\u00a0\n\n2. Under Details > Roster, upload a list of all learners, TAs, and instructors (including you!) in your class.\u00a0 You can add users individually (plus sign) or through bulk upload (paper with the plus sign - See more detailed instructions below).\u00a0\n\n3. If you are planning to pre-assign seating, you can also include the table number/name you want each student to sit at. See more detailed instructions below.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAdding Class Participants in Bulk\u00a0\n\n1. Bulk add using the .csv template.\n\n2. Click \u2018Samples and templates here\u2019, which will open the template as a Google Document.\u00a0\n\n3. Choose File > Make a copy. You can name this copy whatever you like.\u00a0\n\n4. Fill out the CSV file with a list of learners, instructors, and TAs who should be allowed to join this classroom.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n5. When finished, go to File > Download > Comma-separated values (.csv, current sheet) to save to your computer.\u00a0\n\n6. Upload this roster from your computer into the Roster tab of the Portal.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nAssigning Seats\u00a0\n\nOpen seating is the default, but sometimes it can be helpful to assign seats for certain times during the session. You can save multiple presets to use during different points in the class (e.g. start of class, activity time, quiz time). This allows you to easily \u2018move\u2019 learners into different pre-assigned groups, without having to use time during class creating them. You can assign learners to randomly-combined groups of select sizes (1-10 learners) at any time (see detailed instructions here).\n\n\u00a0\n\n1. Under Tables & Presets > Tables, start by customizing the names for each table (e.g., for project groups) if desired.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n2. Under Tables & Presets > Presets, Click \u2018Samples and templates here\u2019, which will open the template as a Google Document.\u00a0\n\n3. Choose File > Make a copy.

When finished, go to File > Download > Comma-separated values (.csv, current sheet) to save to your computer.\u00a0\n\n6. Click \u2018Upload Preset\u2019\n\n7. Name the preset and add a description if helpful (ex: Group Activity - Use this preset when you start group activity).\u00a0\n\n8. Upload the preset by clicking Files.\n\n\u00a0\n\n9. Once presets have been uploaded, you will see a learner\u2019s assigned location for each preset saved next to their name in the roster tab.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nUsing Presets in the Classroom\u00a0\n\n1. Once in your Classroom, at the relevant time, go to Tables > Seating Arrangement > Apply Preset to apply the desired preset.\u00a0\n\n2. Throughout the class, you can choose different presets and Engageli will move learners automatically. You can learn more about table settings in class here and here.\u00a0\n\nClick to learn how to add a tag to your presentation to easily activate a table preset or put learners into a random table arrangement.\n\nRelated article:\n\nHow to Download Your Class Roster\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0Need more help?

As learners interact with the platform, the engagement bar will move up and down.\u00a0\n\nExamples of platform engagement are: raising hands, chatting, asking questions in Q&A, answering polls/quizzes, giving thumbs up or down, etc.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIndividual Engagement Markers\n\nIn addition to tracking full class engagement with the engagement thermometers, you can also track individual learner engagement.\n\n\u00a0\n\n1. Thumbs up/thumbs down: You can ask learners to give you a thumbs up or down. Everyone will see the thumbs appear instantly on the screen, but only instructors and TAs will see individual thumbs up/thumbs down on the learners' video feeds in the Class Gallery.\n\nThumbs up or down can be used to get quick feedback, check understanding, or check if learners are paying attention. Some example questions to use with thumbs are:\n\n\"Do you understand the material we just covered?\"\n\"Give me a thumbs up if you can see my screen.\"\n\nPro Tip! Use thumbs up or down to check engagement for learners with their cameras off. When coming back after a break, if many learners turned off their cameras, ask for a thumbs up if learners are back and then look at the class gallery to see how many thumbs up there are.\n\n\u00a0 Engageli 3.0\u00a0\nIn Engageli 3.0, there are new reactions and sounds for learners and instructors. Click here to learn more.\n\n2. Green Dot marker\n\nEach learner has an engagement marker next to their video feed on the gallery view of the instructor application.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe green dot marker represents when a learner is \"active,\" meaning that they have recently interacted in the classroom in some way. The green dot resets to the maximum size (5) each time a learner does one of the following:\n\nWrites a question or answer in Q&A\nResponds to a poll question\nRaises a hand\nShares screen with their table\nShares screen with their class\nUses thumbs up/down\nUses emojis\nInitiates audio activity (speaking, unmuting microphone)\n\nNote: The green marker decays and appears smaller after some time. The decay is linear, from maximum (5) to minimum (0) over three minutes. Hovering over the indicator in a learner\u2019s video feed shows an engagement value out of 5 (Engagement - 5/5). Any form of activity listed above will turn the marker green.\n\nThe gray dot marker replaces the green markers when a learner who was previously active has not recently interacted in the classroom. In general, a green marker will turn gray after three minutes. The gray marker corresponds to an Engagement rating of 0/5.\nNo marker simply means the learner has not interacted in the classroom at any point.\nThe perforated (dotted) marker indicates that a learner who was seated at a table has left the class. They are still represented in the class by what's called a reservation, as explained in this article.\n\nYou can also see the green dot marker in the LISTS view.\n\n\u00a0\n\n3. Table Engagement\n\nIn addition to the learner\u2019s video feed and LISTS view, the individual engagement markers trigger an engagement indication at the table level, which you can see in the TABLES view.\n\nSimilar to the green dot marker, the green table ring decays and fades away after some time due to inactivity. The decay is linear, from maximum (5) to minimum (0) over three minutes.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0Need more help?

We currently do not recommend Safari or Firefox browsers. If a user is on one of these, invite them to join Engageli via Chrome, Edge, or a browser on Chromium (Opera, Vivaldi, Brave).\nHave you tried refreshing the browser? If not, instruct the user to refresh the browser (log out and log back in). Simply taking this action can sometimes solve your problem.\u00a0\nDo you have an extension running that is blocking screen sharing? Check your extensions or 3rd party anti-virus software.\nDid your permissions get reset? Sometimes permissions are reset without any notification, so recheck your settings to make sure Engageli has permission to share and record your screen.\n\nIf none of this works, reach out to our Support team.\n\nYou can also use the PDF Live Share to share a presentation directly in Engageli without sharing your screen.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0Need more help?

However, if we are not integrated with your institution\u2019s LMS or you want to use specific seating assignments during class, you will need to have a list of learners in the system.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nSetting Up Class Roster\n\n1. Navigate to the Engageli portal and find your classroom.\u00a0\n\n2. Under Details > Roster, upload a list of all learners, TAs, and instructors (including you!) in your class.\u00a0 You can add users individually (plus sign) or through bulk upload (paper with the plus sign - See more detailed instructions below).\u00a0\n\n3. If you are planning to pre-assign seating, you can also include the table number/name you want each student to sit at. See more detailed instructions below.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAdding Class Participants in Bulk\u00a0\n\n1. Bulk add using the .csv template.\n\n2. Click \u2018Samples and templates here\u2019, which will open the template as a Google Document.\u00a0\n\n3. Choose File > Make a copy. You can name this copy whatever you like.\u00a0\n\n4. Fill out the CSV file with a list of learners, instructors, and TAs who should be allowed to join this classroom.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n5. When finished, go to File > Download > Comma-separated values (.csv, current sheet) to save to your computer.\u00a0\n\n6. Upload this roster from your computer into the Roster tab of the Portal.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nAssigning Seats\u00a0\n\nOpen seating is the default, but sometimes it can be helpful to assign seats for certain times during the session. You can save multiple presets to use during different points in the class (e.g. start of class, activity time, quiz time). This allows you to easily \u2018move\u2019 learners into different pre-assigned groups, without having to use time during class creating them. You can assign learners to randomly-combined groups of select sizes (1-10 learners) at any time (see detailed instructions here).\n\n\u00a0\n\n1. Under Tables & Presets > Tables, start by customizing the names for each table (e.g., for project groups) if desired.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n2. Under Tables & Presets > Presets, Click \u2018Samples and templates here\u2019, which will open the template as a Google Document.\u00a0\n\n3. Choose File > Make a copy. You can name this copy whatever you like.\u00a0\n\n4. Add each learner\u2019s email and the table you want them added to upon joining.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nIn this example, we have placed three students in each project group. Upon login, they will automatically be placed at Project Group 1 Table and Project Group 2 Table. Please note: The tables in your .cvs file must match the names of tables you created in step two. If you did not rename tables, use \u201cTable 1\u201d, \u201cTable 2\u201d, as in the default labels.\n\n\u00a0\n\n5. When finished, go to File > Download > Comma-separated values (.csv, current sheet) to save to your computer.\u00a0\n\n6. Click \u2018Upload Preset\u2019\n\n7. Name the preset and add a description if helpful (ex: Group Activity - Use this preset when you start group activity).\u00a0\n\n8. Upload the preset by clicking Files.\n\n\u00a0\n\n9. Once presets have been uploaded, you will see a learner\u2019s assigned location for each preset saved next to their name in the roster tab.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nUsing Presets in the Classroom\u00a0\n\n1. Once in your Classroom, at the relevant time, go to Tables > Seating Arrangement > Apply Preset to apply the desired preset.\u00a0\n\n2. Throughout the class, you can choose different presets and Engageli will move learners automatically. You can learn more about table settings in class here and here.\u00a0\n\nClick to learn how to add a tag to your presentation to easily activate a table preset or put learners into a random table arrangement.\n\nRelated article:\n\nHow to Download Your Class Roster\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0Need more help?

This means that as the instructor you will hear the audio feeds from all learners, and they will hear each other, regardless of where they are seated.\n\nWhen to use: the beginning of class, or entire classroom discussions\n\n\u00a0\n\nTable Mode:\n\nWhen you enable Table Mode, learners will hear only their table mates and you will only hear learners who raise their hands.\u00a0\n\nWhen to use: small group discussions, projects, and other table activities\n\n\u00a0\n\nYou can easily toggle between the two modes from the bottom right corner of the screen.\n\n\u00a0 \n\nIf you or a co-instructor join a table, Engageli automatically switches to Table Mode. When at a table, you will only hear the learners at that table (and any learners at other tables that raise their hands).\u00a0 While an instructor is at a table, no instructor will be able to change the mode to Room Mode.\u00a0\n\nFor learners, the tablemates panel will automatically close when switching the audio mode to Room mode from the Table audio mode so learners direct their attention back to the class.\n\nIf you would like to hear all the learners concurrently while at the podium in Table Mode, click on the three dots and choose \u2018Hear tables while on podium in table mode\u2019.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nYou can hover over the Table Mode and Room Mode buttons to see who you can hear and who can hear you.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: All audio will be recorded in Room Mode and only those on podium (learners with hands raised or instructor(s)) will be recorded in Table Mode.\n\n\u00a0\n\nClick to learn how to add a tag to your presentation for a reminder to switch between Room Mode and Table Mode.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0Need more help?

These markers can help you keep a pulse on how the class is engaging with and learning the content so you can adjust as needed.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIndividual Engagement Markers\n\n1. Thumbs up/thumbs down\n\nYou can ask learners to use the reactions to give you a thumbs up or down. Everyone will see the thumbs appear instantly on the screen, but only instructors and TAs will see individual thumbs up/thumbs down on the learners' video feeds in the Class Gallery.\n\nThumbs up or down can be used to get quick feedback, check understanding, or check if learners are paying attention. Some example questions to use with thumbs are:\n\n\"Do you understand the material we just covered?\"\n\"Give me a thumbs up if you can see my screen.\"\n\nPro Tip! Use thumbs up or down to check engagement for learners with their cameras off. When coming back after a break, if many learners turned off their cameras, ask for a thumbs up if learners are back and then look at the class gallery to see how many thumbs up there are.\n\nThere are additional reactions and sounds for learners and instructors. Click here to learn more.\u00a0\n\n2. Green Dot Marker\n\nEach learner has an engagement marker in the bottom right corner of their video feed in the Class Gallery.\n\nThe green dot marker represents when a learner is \"active,\" meaning that they have recently interacted in the classroom in some way. The green dot resets to the maximum size (5) each time a learner does one of the following:\n\nWrites a question or answer in Q&A\nResponds to a poll question\nRaises hand\nLowers hand\nShares screen with their table\nShares screen with their class\nUses thumbs up/down\nUses other emojis reactions\nSends a chat message (private chats are not included)\nInitiates audio activity (speaking, unmuting microphone)\n\nNote: The green marker decays and appears smaller after some time. The decay is linear, from maximum (5) to minimum (0) over three minutes. Hovering over the indicator in a learner\u2019s video feed shows an engagement value out of 5 (Engagement - 5/5). Any form of activity listed above will turn the marker green.\n\nThe gray dot marker replaces the green markers when a learner who was previously active has not recently interacted in the classroom. In general, a green marker will turn gray after three minutes. The gray marker corresponds to an Engagement rating of 0/5.\n\nNo marker simply means the learner has not interacted in the classroom at any point.\n\nThe perforated (dotted) marker indicates that a learner who was seated at a table has left the class. They are still represented in the class by what's called a reservation, as explained in this article.\n\nYou can also see the green dot marker next to the learner's name in the List view in the Tables tab.\n\n\u00a0\n\nTable Engagement\n\nIn addition to the learner\u2019s video feed and the Lists view, the individual engagement markers trigger an engagement indication at the table level, which you can see in the Tables tab at the top of the screen.\n\nSimilar to the green dot marker, the green table ring decays and fades away after some time due to inactivity. The decay is linear, from maximum (5) to minimum (0) over three minutes.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0Need more help?

Do you have 3rd party anti-virus software that is blocking screen sharing? Check your 3rd party anti-virus software.\n\n3. Did your permissions get reset? Sometimes permissions are reset without any notification, so recheck your settings to make sure Engageli has permission to share and record your screen.\n\nIf none of this works, reach out to our Support team.\n\nYou can also use the PDF Live share to\u00a0share a presentation directly in Engageli without sharing your screen.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0Need more help?

When the learner re-joins the classroom, they will automatically be placed at the same table as before. Because of having an assigned seat at the table, a table of seven present learners and three reserved is considered full.\n\nYou may want to remove table reservations to free up space at certain tables or create random table groups without including reservations in the count.\n\nWithin Tables view, you can see all reservations represented by a dotted line around a learner\u2019s profile icon.\n\n\u00a0\n\nInstructions\n\n1. Go to the TABLES view.\n\n2. In the drop-down menu Action, select Remove All Reservations.\u00a0\n\n3.

This is great for any group work or discussions.\n\nInstructions\n1. To join a table, click the Tables tab.\n2. Hover over the table that you'd like to join and click the JOIN button.\n\nWhen you join the table, you will see, hear, and interact only with members of the table you joined. This is great when groups have a question on an in-class assignment and you don't want to interrupt the entire class.\n\n3. When you are ready to leave the table, click the Back to podium button. Engageli 3.1 users have several options for returning to the podium.\n\nNote: The audio will automatically switch from Room Mode to Table Mode.

Go to the Seating Arrangement drop-down menu in the Tables view.\u00a0\n\n2. Select Random Arrangement Table Size.\n\n3. Choose the number of learners you would like at each table. The system will automatically break learners into randomized groups.\n\nYou can also reserve any of the first 3 tables for staff or other participants who you don't want to move during the random arrangement. In Engageli 3.0, this is called Skip Tables.\n\nNote: If learners have a reservation, then they will be treated as learners. Make sure to remove any reservations before you do this! (See instructions on reservations here).\n\nYou can save the table arrangement you created as a preset that you can use again. Click for information on how to create a table preset during a class.\n\n\u00a0\n\nMoving Learners to Different Tables\u00a0\n\nInstructions\n1. Navigate to the Tables view.\n2. Click the profile icon of the learner you wish to move.\n\n3. Choose a new table for the learner from the drop-down menu.\n\n4.

However, if we are not integrated with your institution\u2019s LMS or you want to use specific seating assignments during class, you will need to have a list of learners in the system.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nSetting Up Class Roster\n\n1. Navigate to the Engageli portal and find your classroom.\u00a0\n\n2. Under Details > Roster, upload a list of all learners, TAs, and instructors (including you!) in your class.\u00a0 You can add users individually (plus sign) or through bulk upload (paper with the plus sign - See more detailed instructions below).\u00a0\n\n3. If you are planning to pre-assign seating, you can also include the table number/name you want each student to sit at. See more detailed instructions below.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAdding Class Participants in Bulk\u00a0\n\n1. Bulk add using the .csv template.\n\n2. Click \u2018Samples and templates here\u2019, which will open the template as a Google Document.\u00a0\n\n3. Choose File > Make a copy. You can name this copy whatever you like.\u00a0\n\n4. Fill out the CSV file with a list of learners, instructors, and TAs who should be allowed to join this classroom.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n5. When finished, go to File > Download > Comma-separated values (.csv, current sheet) to save to your computer.\u00a0\n\n6. Upload this roster from your computer into the Roster tab of the Portal.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nAssigning Seats\u00a0\n\nOpen seating is the default, but sometimes it can be helpful to assign seats for certain times during the session. You can save multiple presets to use during different points in the class (e.g. start of class, activity time, quiz time). This allows you to easily \u2018move\u2019 learners into different pre-assigned groups, without having to use time during class creating them. You can assign learners to randomly-combined groups of select sizes (1-10 learners) at any time (see detailed instructions here).\n\n\u00a0\n\n1. Under Tables & Presets > Tables, start by customizing the names for each table (e.g., for project groups) if desired.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n2. Under Tables & Presets > Presets, Click \u2018Samples and templates here\u2019, which will open the template as a Google Document.\u00a0\n\n3. Choose File > Make a copy. You can name this copy whatever you like.\u00a0\n\n4. Add each learner\u2019s email and the table you want them added to upon joining.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nIn this example, we have placed three students in each project group. Upon login, they will automatically be placed at Project Group 1 Table and Project Group 2 Table. Please note: The tables in your .cvs file must match the names of tables you created in step two. If you did not rename tables, use \u201cTable 1\u201d, \u201cTable 2\u201d, as in the default labels.\n\n\u00a0\n\n5. When finished, go to File > Download > Comma-separated values (.csv, current sheet) to save to your computer.\u00a0\n\n6. Click \u2018Upload Preset\u2019\n\n7. Name the preset and add a description if helpful (ex: Group Activity - Use this preset when you start group activity).\u00a0\n\n8. Upload the preset by clicking Files.\n\n\u00a0\n\n9. Once presets have been uploaded, you will see a learner\u2019s assigned location for each preset saved next to their name in the roster tab.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nUsing Presets in the Classroom\u00a0\n\n1. Once in your Classroom, at the relevant time, go to Tables > Seating Arrangement > Apply Preset to apply the desired preset.\u00a0\n\n2. Throughout the class, you can choose different presets and Engageli will move learners automatically. You can learn more about table settings in class here and here.\u00a0\n\nClick to learn how to add a tag to your presentation to easily activate a table preset or put learners into a random table arrangement.\n\nRelated article:\n\nHow to Download Your Class Roster\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0Need more help?

Playback Rooms are open 24/7 and learners can use them to create online collaborative spaces and complete the assigned tasks together.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAccessing the Playback Room\n\nYou can access the Playback Room directly from the same link that you use for your live Engageli classes.\u00a0\n\n1. Open the classroom URL and select Playback room at the top of the screen.\n\n2. Then, click Start my Playback room.\u00a0\n\nCreate a Collaboration Space for My Group\n\nThe first step for creating a Collaboration Space is to get the invite link for your Playback room.\u00a0\n\n1.

Hover over the table that you'd like to join and click the JOIN button.\n\nWhen you join the table, you will see, hear, and interact only with members of the table you joined. This is great when groups have a question on an in-class assignment and you don't want to interrupt the entire class.\n\n3. When you are ready to leave the table, click the Back to podium button. Engageli 3.1 users have several options for returning to the podium.\n\nNote: The audio will automatically switch from Room Mode to Table Mode. When you leave the table, you will have to switch the audio setting back to Room Mode to enable a full-class discussion. Click to learn more about the audio settings.\n\nNew in Engageli 3.1!\n\nIn Engageli 3.1, instructors will peek at or observe tables unobtrusively without disturbing the learners.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nCreating Random Tables Groups\u00a0\n\nThis is a great way to encourage learner engagement is to randomly arrange table groups for discussions.\u00a0\n\nInstructions\n\n1. Go to the Seating Arrangement drop-down menu in the Tables view.\u00a0\n\n2. Select Random Arrangement Table Size.\n\n3. Choose the number of learners you would like at each table. The system will automatically break learners into randomized groups.\n\nYou can also reserve any of the first 3 tables for staff or other participants who you don't want to move during the random arrangement. In Engageli 3.0, this is called Skip Tables.\n\nNote: If learners have a reservation, then they will be treated as learners. Make sure to remove any reservations before you do this! (See instructions on reservations here).\n\nYou can save the table arrangement you created as a preset that you can use again. Click for information on how to create a table preset during a class.\n\n\u00a0\n\nMoving Learners to Different Tables\u00a0\n\nInstructions\n1. Navigate to the Tables view.\n2. Click the profile icon of the learner you wish to move.\n\n3. Choose a new table for the learner from the drop-down menu.\n\n4. Or, you can simply drag and drop the learner to a different table.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0Need more help?

(v3.1)\n2 months ago Updated\nFollow\nNot yet followed by anyone\n\n\u00a0Engageli 3.1 Feature\u00a0\n\nThis feature is available in Engageli 3.1. Click to learn more about Engageli 3.1. Click to read the Engageli 3.1 release notes.\n\nEngageli Modules allow you to author asynchronous modules for participants, including Engageli recordings, supplemental materials, and content and assessments to enrich the learning experience. Here are a few ways you can use Modules to enhance your learning offerings on Engageli.\n\n\u00a0\nHigher Education Corporate Settings\n\nEnhance existing course materials: If you\u2019re already teaching live classes on Engageli and you\u2019d like to incorporate more activities or make your existing content or course more engaging, you can now include additional materials as PDFs, add new polls, or provide more information through your own recordings (mp4) or Youtube videos. You can create structured Modules for each unit of your course by adding Tasks within a Module. Each Task within the Module must be completed by the learner within the Playback Room before moving to the next Task, and Modules can also be set to be completed in the required order. Progress trackers will allow you to gate and sequence tasks within Modules for learners.\n\nEnable the flipped classroom or asynchronous class model: If you plan to teach a flipped course or completely asynchronous course, you can do all of the above, as well as create collaborative learning activities for them to complete, such as contributing to editable Google/Microsoft 365 materials or opening and using a whiteboard. You will use the live classroom to create recordings for them to review and can enable these tools and provide instructions for them to collaboratively complete. You can also choose recordings made in any of your Engageli classrooms, or upload any .mp4 recording and add them as a Module.\u00a0\n\nAssign an asynchronous quiz or assessment: You can use Engageli poll tags in a PDF to create quizzes and assessments to gauge learners' learning and mastery that can be completed in the Module. The system will automatically convert the tags to a poll your learners can answer. You can track progress and surface any learners who may be falling behind or at risk.\n\nGather learner feedback: You can use Engageli poll tags to create surveys to offer learners opportunities to provide feedback about the course and their experience. Learners will be able to provide feedback without using a different tool or worrying about missing a survey link sent in an email.\n\nEnable faculty to work through training or skill-building together: If you are an instructional designer or administrator, you can create university-wide learning content, which groups of faculty and instructors can complete in a Playback Room together. The host of the Playback Room can invite up to 9 other users to review recordings, complete learning activities, brainstorm solutions to teaching challenges, and complete assessments. You can review individual and overall Assignment progress as the course designer or admin.\n\n\u00a0\nRelated Articles:\nHow to Create Modules\nHow to Track Progress for Modules\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0Need more help?

As the tables fill with learners, more tables are added automatically. However, you can manually add tables 5 at a time with no more than 40 recommended.\n\nInstructions\n\n1. Navigate to the Tables view.\n\n2. Click the Actions menu.\n\n3. Select Add 5 tables.\n\nNOTE: At this time, you cannot remove tables that have been added to the classroom.\n\n\u00a0\nRename Tables\n\nYou can easily rename the tables in your Engageli classroom. Table names can mirror the instructional model and range from project group names, book characters, or course topics to fun names based on hobbies or interests.\n\nInstructions\n\nDuring Class\n\n1. Go to the TABLES view.\n\n2. Hover over the table you want to rename.\n\n3. Click the existing name of the table.\n\n4. Enter the new name.\n\n5. Click the table to save the change.\n\n6. You will see a confirmation notification at the top of the screen.\n\nNote: The new table names will be saved and persist in the Admin Portal and the next time you log into the classroom.\n\nAdmin Portal\n\n1.

Click the gear icon to open the settings.\n\n2. Select Classroom Configuration.\n\n3. Use the slider to select the number of seats for the tables.\n\n4. Click the Close button. The changes will be applied immediately.\n\nPro Tip! When deciding the number of seats, keep in mind that if you have multiple TAs who will visit tables, an available empty seat will be needed. Instructors, co-instructors, and one TA can visit tables without needing an empty seat.\n\nEngageli classroom with 5 seats per table\n\n\u00a0\n\nRemove Table Reservations\n\nTable reservations ensure that a learner can keep their spot at a table should they lose their internet connection and get logged out of the classroom. When the learner re-joins the classroom, they will automatically be placed at the same table as before. Because of having an assigned seat at the table, a table of seven present learners and three reserved is considered full.\n\nYou may want to remove table reservations to free up space at certain tables or create random table groups without including reservations in the count.\n\nWithin Tables view, you can see all reservations represented by a dotted line around a learner\u2019s profile icon.\n\n\u00a0\n\nInstructions\n\n1. Go to the TABLES view.\n\n2. In the drop-down menu Action, select Remove All Reservations.\u00a0\n\n3. You can remove an individual reservation by clicking on the learner's icon at the table and then removing it.\u00a0\n\nNote: Individual reservations will be automatically removed after 5 minutes of inactivity.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0Need more help?

Click to understand more about Room Mode and Table Mode and how to effectively use Engageli's audio modes to foster active learning and collaboration.\u00a0\n\nEngageli now has two main audio modes, Room Mode and Table Mode.\n\nRoom Mode:\n\nThis is the default when you enter your Engageli classroom. This means that as the instructor you will hear the audio feeds from all learners, and they will hear each other, regardless of where they are seated.\n\nWhen to use: the beginning of class, or entire classroom discussions\n\n\u00a0\n\nTable Mode:\n\nWhen you enable Table Mode, learners will hear only their table mates and you will only hear learners who raise their hands.\u00a0\n\nWhen to use: small group discussions, projects, and other table activities\n\n\u00a0\n\nYou can easily toggle between the two modes from the bottom right corner of the screen.\n\n\u00a0 \n\nIf you or a co-instructor join a table, Engageli automatically switches to Table Mode. When at a table, you will only hear the learners at that table (and any learners at other tables that raise their hands).\u00a0 While an instructor is at a table, no instructor will be able to change the mode to Room Mode.\u00a0\n\nFor learners, the tablemates panel will automatically close when switching the audio mode to Room mode from the Table audio mode so learners direct their attention back to the class.\n\nIf you would like to hear all the learners concurrently while at the podium in Table Mode, click on the three dots and choose \u2018Hear tables while on podium in table mode\u2019.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nYou can hover over the Table Mode and Room Mode buttons to see who you can hear and who can hear you.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: All audio will be recorded in Room Mode and only those on podium (learners with hands raised or instructor(s)) will be recorded in Table Mode.\n\n\u00a0\n\nClick to learn how to add a tag to your presentation for a reminder to switch between Room Mode and Table Mode.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0Need more help?

However, if we are not integrated with your institution\u2019s LMS or you want to use specific seating assignments during class, you will need to have a list of learners in the system.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nSetting Up Class Roster\n\n1. Navigate to the Engageli portal and find your classroom.\u00a0\n\n2. Under Details > Roster, upload a list of all learners, TAs, and instructors (including you!) in your class.\u00a0 You can add users individually (plus sign) or through bulk upload (paper with the plus sign - See more detailed instructions below).\u00a0\n\n3. If you are planning to pre-assign seating, you can also include the table number/name you want each student to sit at. See more detailed instructions below.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAdding Class Participants in Bulk\u00a0\n\n1. Bulk add using the .csv template.\n\n2. Click \u2018Samples and templates here\u2019, which will open the template as a Google Document.\u00a0\n\n3. Choose File > Make a copy. You can name this copy whatever you like.\u00a0\n\n4. Fill out the CSV file with a list of learners, instructors, and TAs who should be allowed to join this classroom.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n5. When finished, go to File > Download > Comma-separated values (.csv, current sheet) to save to your computer.\u00a0\n\n6. Upload this roster from your computer into the Roster tab of the Portal.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nAssigning Seats\u00a0\n\nOpen seating is the default, but sometimes it can be helpful to assign seats for certain times during the session. You can save multiple presets to use during different points in the class (e.g. start of class, activity time, quiz time). This allows you to easily \u2018move\u2019 learners into different pre-assigned groups, without having to use time during class creating them. You can assign learners to randomly-combined groups of select sizes (1-10 learners) at any time (see detailed instructions here).\n\n\u00a0\n\n1. Under Tables & Presets > Tables, start by customizing the names for each table (e.g., for project groups) if desired.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n2. Under Tables & Presets > Presets, Click \u2018Samples and templates here\u2019, which will open the template as a Google Document.\u00a0\n\n3. Choose File > Make a copy. You can name this copy whatever you like.\u00a0\n\n4. Add each learner\u2019s email and the table you want them added to upon joining.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nIn this example, we have placed three students in each project group. Upon login, they will automatically be placed at Project Group 1 Table and Project Group 2 Table. Please note: The tables in your .cvs file must match the names of tables you created in step two. If you did not rename tables, use \u201cTable 1\u201d, \u201cTable 2\u201d, as in the default labels.\n\n\u00a0\n\n5. When finished, go to File > Download > Comma-separated values (.csv, current sheet) to save to your computer.\u00a0\n\n6. Click \u2018Upload Preset\u2019\n\n7. Name the preset and add a description if helpful (ex: Group Activity - Use this preset when you start group activity).\u00a0\n\n8. Upload the preset by clicking Files.\n\n\u00a0\n\n9. Once presets have been uploaded, you will see a learner\u2019s assigned location for each preset saved next to their name in the roster tab.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nUsing Presets in the Classroom\u00a0\n\n1. Once in your Classroom, at the relevant time, go to Tables > Seating Arrangement > Apply Preset to apply the desired preset.\u00a0\n\n2. Throughout the class, you can choose different presets and Engageli will move learners automatically. You can learn more about table settings in class here and here.\u00a0\n\nClick to learn how to add a tag to your presentation to easily activate a table preset or put learners into a random table arrangement.\n\nRelated article:\n\nHow to Download Your Class Roster\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0Need more help?

{"url": "https://support.engageli.com/hc/en-us/articles/8672344120731-Analytics-Using-Engagement-Data", "html": "Analytics - Using Engagement Data\n5 months ago Updated\nFollow\nNot yet followed by anyone\n\nEngageli collects a wide variety of engagement data, both aggregated and individual, that can be used to identify opportunities for improvement in the design and delivery of instruction.\n\nRaise Hand Analytics\n\nEngageli\u2019s Raise Hand feature allows participants at tables to address the entire classroom from the podium. Instructors can use this data to track engagement during their sessions and answer questions such as:\n\nWhich learners are participating in the session (and which are not)?\nAm I, as the instructor, actively involving my learners in the session by asking questions, soliciting feedback, and asking them to share?\n\nChat Analytics\n\nChats can make virtual learning more efficient as questions are answered in real-time in context with instruction. Chat messages increase opportunities for learner-to-learner collaboration, as well as learner-to-instructor interaction. Chat also allows learners who are not able to turn on their microphone or camera to still actively participate in class by sending messages, uploading materials, collaborating with their tablemates, and engaging in community-building or other learning activities.\n\nA classroom with a larger percentage of messages sent to tablemates rather than private, 1-on-1 messages could reflect strong collaboration among the learners.\n\nPoll Analytics\n\nPolls can be presented in the course material as checks for comprehension and engagement in real-time. Using polls provides instructors an opportunity to adjust the pace of the class and can foster a discussion about the results in an effort to make the material more understandable. Polls also allow learners who are not able to turn on their microphone or camera to participate in checks for understanding or community-building polls, which can be used to determine learning gains, engagement, and if individual attention is required.\n\nPoll participation can indicate learner sentiment about instructional pedagogies used during the class.\n\nSpeak Time Analytics\n\nSpeak time is an important element of learning. Not only does talking help learners process the information presented during a lesson, it also promotes peer-to-peer learning and builds connections and community. Opportunities for table discussion (private to the table and never recorded) provide learners psychological safety and time to reflect and collaborate on the concepts presented. Interlacing class time with group activities at tables can provide structured ways for learners to practice critical thinking and reflect on the content presented.\n\nMeasuring learner speak time helps instructors understand the participation equity of learners in the class. It can also help instructors redesign their class session plans by incorporating additional time for group activities to increase speaking time and overall engagement in the classroom.\n\nReviewing the total learner speaking time vs instructor speaking time can help determine the proportion of direct instruction during a class.\n\nAttendance Analytics\n\nResearch shows that attendance is an important factor in learner achievement, as learners are more likely to succeed in academics when they attend class sessions consistently and are exposed to instruction.\n\nAttendance data can also be used to identify learners who are not attending and potentially falling behind, or who might need a success coach to reach out to ensure retention. Playback Room attendance data can be used to track whether absent or asynchronous learners review class recordings and engage with the course material and if follow-up attention is needed.\n\nGrades\n\nGrades allow instructors to evaluate learners and provide feedback on their work and performance.\n\nGrades recorded in Engageli can be used to identify learners who are falling behind, are having trouble with retention, or need individual support, supplemental instruction, or tutoring.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0Need more help?

{"url": "https://support.engageli.com/hc/en-us/articles/8562644617627-How-to-Track-Learner-Engagement-During-Class", "html": "How to Track Learner Engagement During Class\n1 month ago Updated\nFollow\nNot yet followed by anyone\n\nThere are many ways to track engagement in Engageli. These markers can help you keep a pulse on how the class is engaging with and learning the content so you can adjust as needed.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIndividual Engagement Markers\n\n1. Thumbs up/thumbs down\n\nYou can ask learners to use the reactions to give you a thumbs up or down. Everyone will see the thumbs appear instantly on the screen, but only instructors and TAs will see individual thumbs up/thumbs down on the learners' video feeds in the Class Gallery.\n\nThumbs up or down can be used to get quick feedback, check understanding, or check if learners are paying attention. Some example questions to use with thumbs are:\n\n\"Do you understand the material we just covered?\"\n\"Give me a thumbs up if you can see my screen.\"\n\nPro Tip! Use thumbs up or down to check engagement for learners with their cameras off. When coming back after a break, if many learners turned off their cameras, ask for a thumbs up if learners are back and then look at the class gallery to see how many thumbs up there are.\n\nThere are additional reactions and sounds for learners and instructors. Click here to learn more.\u00a0\n\n2. Green Dot Marker\n\nEach learner has an engagement marker in the bottom right corner of their video feed in the Class Gallery.\n\nThe green dot marker represents when a learner is \"active,\" meaning that they have recently interacted in the classroom in some way. The green dot resets to the maximum size (5) each time a learner does one of the following:\n\nWrites a question or answer in Q&A\nResponds to a poll question\nRaises hand\nLowers hand\nShares screen with their table\nShares screen with their class\nUses thumbs up/down\nUses other emojis reactions\nSends a chat message (private chats are not included)\nInitiates audio activity (speaking, unmuting microphone)\n\nNote: The green marker decays and appears smaller after some time. The decay is linear, from maximum (5) to minimum (0) over three minutes. Hovering over the indicator in a learner\u2019s video feed shows an engagement value out of 5 (Engagement - 5/5). Any form of activity listed above will turn the marker green.\n\nThe gray dot marker replaces the green markers when a learner who was previously active has not recently interacted in the classroom. In general, a green marker will turn gray after three minutes. The gray marker corresponds to an Engagement rating of 0/5.\n\nNo marker simply means the learner has not interacted in the classroom at any point.\n\nThe perforated (dotted) marker indicates that a learner who was seated at a table has left the class. They are still represented in the class by what's called a reservation, as explained in this article.\n\nYou can also see the green dot marker next to the learner's name in the List view in the Tables tab.\n\n\u00a0\n\nTable Engagement\n\nIn addition to the learner\u2019s video feed and the Lists view, the individual engagement markers trigger an engagement indication at the table level, which you can see in the Tables tab at the top of the screen.\n\nSimilar to the green dot marker, the green table ring decays and fades away after some time due to inactivity. The decay is linear, from maximum (5) to minimum (0) over three minutes.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0Need more help?

Playback Rooms are open 24/7 and learners can use them to create online collaborative spaces and complete the assigned tasks together.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAccessing the Playback Room\n\nYou can access the Playback Room directly from the same link that you use for your live Engageli classes.\u00a0\n\n1. Open the classroom URL and select Playback room at the top of the screen.\n\n2. Then, click Start my Playback room.\u00a0\n\nCreate a Collaboration Space for My Group\n\nThe first step for creating a Collaboration Space is to get the invite link for your Playback room.\u00a0\n\n1. In your Playback room, click By Invitation in the bottom left corner.\n\n2. Click Copy invite link.\u00a0\n\nYou can send the link to your peers as well as guests.\n\n\u00a0\n\nInstructions for Engageli 3.41: The first step for creating a Collaboration Space is to create a permanent link for the Playback room.\u00a0\n\n1.

Click By invitation in the bottom left corner.\u00a0\n\n2. Select Open.\u00a0\n\nIn Engageli 3.1.41, to set the room to Public Mode, select Private Mode in the bottom left corner and then switch to Public Mode.\n\nThis is how public Playback rooms appear to users.\u00a0\n\nAs the host who started the group, you will retain the playback controls. That means you will control which class recording, video, or assignment is selected for review. To pass the playback controls to another participant:\n\n1. Click the Gallery\u00a0button at the bottom of the screen.\n\n2. Then click the three-dot menu in the person's video feed.\n\n3.

Tables are built so learners will always be in small groups and you do not need to create breakout rooms for group activities. This allows you to create rich learning experiences at the tables while learners also feel simultaneously connected to the larger class and the instructor.\n\n\u00a0\n\nJoining Tables\n\nCreating Random Tables Groups\u00a0\n\nMoving learners to different Tables\n\n\u00a0\n\nJoining Tables\n\nJoining tables allows you to leave the podium and \u201cvisit\u201d groups of learners at tables, much like \u201cwalking the room\u201d in an in-person class. This is great for any group work or discussions.\n\nInstructions\n1. To join a table, click the Tables tab.\n2. Hover over the table that you'd like to join and click the JOIN button.\n\nWhen you join the table, you will see, hear, and interact only with members of the table you joined. This is great when groups have a question on an in-class assignment and you don't want to interrupt the entire class.\n\n3. When you are ready to leave the table, click the Back to podium button. Engageli 3.1 users have several options for returning to the podium.\n\nNote: The audio will automatically switch from Room Mode to Table Mode. When you leave the table, you will have to switch the audio setting back to Room Mode to enable a full-class discussion. Click to learn more about the audio settings.\n\nNew in Engageli 3.1!\n\nIn Engageli 3.1, instructors will peek at or observe tables unobtrusively without disturbing the learners.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nCreating Random Tables Groups\u00a0\n\nThis is a great way to encourage learner engagement is to randomly arrange table groups for discussions.\u00a0\n\nInstructions\n\n1. Go to the Seating Arrangement drop-down menu in the Tables view.\u00a0\n\n2. Select Random Arrangement Table Size.\n\n3. Choose the number of learners you would like at each table. The system will automatically break learners into randomized groups.\n\nYou can also reserve any of the first 3 tables for staff or other participants who you don't want to move during the random arrangement. In Engageli 3.0, this is called Skip Tables.\n\nNote: If learners have a reservation, then they will be treated as learners. Make sure to remove any reservations before you do this! (See instructions on reservations here).\n\nYou can save the table arrangement you created as a preset that you can use again. Click for information on how to create a table preset during a class.\n\n\u00a0\n\nMoving Learners to Different Tables\u00a0\n\nInstructions\n1. Navigate to the Tables view.\n2. Click the profile icon of the learner you wish to move.\n\n3. Choose a new table for the learner from the drop-down menu.\n\n4. Or, you can simply drag and drop the learner to a different table.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0Need more help?

After you turn on the poll, the poll will be displayed in the recording. If you want asynchronous learners to see the live results, click \"Share Results\" in the live session. Asynchronous learners will need to answer the poll before seeing the live results.\nAny questions posted in the Q&A during the live class will be displayed in the Playback Room. Learners watching the recording can answer the same questions that were posed in the live session. The questions will appear to any learner who attended, whether during the live session or viewing the recording in the Playback Room.\nMessages sent in the Chat are not included in the recording and do not persist in the Playback room.\nIf you distribute a Class or Table Whiteboard to learners during the session, these will be included in the recording. We recommend instructing asynchronous learners to replicate any whiteboard activities done in the live class, as the host can open a whiteboard in the Playback Room.\n\nNew in Engageli 3.1!\n\nIn Engageli 3.1, instructors can change their settings to include the Class Gallery in recordings.

Playback Rooms are open 24/7 and learners can use them to create online collaborative spaces and complete the assigned tasks together.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAccessing the Playback Room\n\nYou can access the Playback Room directly from the same link that you use for your live Engageli classes.\u00a0\n\n1. Open the classroom URL and select Playback room at the top of the screen.\n\n2. Then, click Start my Playback room.\u00a0\n\nCreate a Collaboration Space for My Group\n\nThe first step for creating a Collaboration Space is to get the invite link for your Playback room.\u00a0\n\n1.

In your Playback Room, click the Invite & Info icon in the bottom left corner.\n\n2. Click Create Permanent Link.\u00a0\n\n3. Once the Permanent Link is created, you can copy it to share with your peers as well as guests.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0Create a Collaboration Space for Anyone to Join\n\nBy default, Playback rooms are set to Private, which means that a user needs a guest link from the room in order to join. If set to Open (or Public Mode), your Playback room appears on the login screen for your classmates and peers and they will be able to join without a guest link.\n\nTo set the room to Open:\n\n1. Click By invitation in the bottom left corner.\u00a0\n\n2. Select Open.\u00a0\n\nIn Engageli 3.1.41, to set the room to Public Mode, select Private Mode in the bottom left corner and then switch to Public Mode.\n\nThis is how public Playback rooms appear to users.\u00a0\n\nAs the host who started the group, you will retain the playback controls.

Click to learn more about Engageli 3.1. Click to read the Engageli 3.1 release notes.\n\nThere may be some learners or participants who are unable to join the session via their computer or mobile apps due to connectivity issues or who simply want to participate in sessions or meetings by audio only. The dial-in option allows users to join the live session as a learner by calling the session-specific number which can be enabled in the Admin Portal. If learners dial into the session, they will be listed\u00a0in the Class Gallery as anonymous \u201cPhone Guests\u201d and they will not appear in the attendance analytics for the class session. They will be placed at a table like all other learners and will get a notification of any audio changes, so they will know if they are speaking to the whole class or just their tablemates. If they would like to unmute to speak, they can press 2, and repeat to mute. If they would like to come to the Podium to be heard by the whole class, they can press 1, and repeat to lower their hand.\u00a0\n\nBest Practices\n\nIf you have a camera-on policy for your classroom, consider making an allowance for dial-in users, as they will not have the ability to be camera-on.\n\nEnsure you communicate group engagement guidelines, such as when and how you'd like learners to unmute and speak, raise their hands, or when they need to stay muted during presentations of content, direct instruction, videos, etc.\n\nDial-in users will not have a displayed name. To ensure that you provide attendance credit or know who is in attendance, we recommend asking all users to introduce themselves by unmuting and sharing their names and pronouns. You or your staff can document your dial-in users' names in the Notes for future reference.\n\nSet aside 1-2 minutes during table-based activities for learners to introduce themselves at their tables. Assign one group manager or representative to take notes or adds ideas from dial-in users to Whiteboards or shared Google/Microsoft 365 materials, so their contributions are included.\n\nRecord your sessions so that dial-in users can return to the recording in the Playback Room and engage in interactive components such as Polls, Whiteboards, Google/Microsoft 365 materials.\n\nHow dial-in learners appear in the Class Gallery\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0Need more help?

Click to read the Engageli 3.1 release notes.\n\nEngageli Modules allow you to author asynchronous modules for participants, including Engageli recordings, supplemental materials, and content and assessments to enrich the learning experience. Here are a few ways you can use Modules to enhance your learning offerings on Engageli.\n\n\u00a0\nHigher Education Corporate Settings\n\nEnhance existing course materials: If you\u2019re already teaching live classes on Engageli and you\u2019d like to incorporate more activities or make your existing content or course more engaging, you can now include additional materials as PDFs, add new polls, or provide more information through your own recordings (mp4) or Youtube videos. You can create structured Modules for each unit of your course by adding Tasks within a Module. Each Task within the Module must be completed by the learner within the Playback Room before moving to the next Task, and Modules can also be set to be completed in the required order. Progress trackers will allow you to gate and sequence tasks within Modules for learners.\n\nEnable the flipped classroom or asynchronous class model: If you plan to teach a flipped course or completely asynchronous course, you can do all of the above, as well as create collaborative learning activities for them to complete, such as contributing to editable Google/Microsoft 365 materials or opening and using a whiteboard. You will use the live classroom to create recordings for them to review and can enable these tools and provide instructions for them to collaboratively complete. You can also choose recordings made in any of your Engageli classrooms, or upload any .mp4 recording and add them as a Module.\u00a0\n\nAssign an asynchronous quiz or assessment: You can use Engageli poll tags in a PDF to create quizzes and assessments to gauge learners' learning and mastery that can be completed in the Module. The system will automatically convert the tags to a poll your learners can answer. You can track progress and surface any learners who may be falling behind or at risk.\n\nGather learner feedback: You can use Engageli poll tags to create surveys to offer learners opportunities to provide feedback about the course and their experience. Learners will be able to provide feedback without using a different tool or worrying about missing a survey link sent in an email.\n\nEnable faculty to work through training or skill-building together: If you are an instructional designer or administrator, you can create university-wide learning content, which groups of faculty and instructors can complete in a Playback Room together. The host of the Playback Room can invite up to 9 other users to review recordings, complete learning activities, brainstorm solutions to teaching challenges, and complete assessments. You can review individual and overall Assignment progress as the course designer or admin.\n\n\u00a0\nRelated Articles:\nHow to Create Modules\nHow to Track Progress for Modules\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0Need more help?

If learners dial into the session, they will be listed\u00a0in the Class Gallery as anonymous \u201cPhone Guests\u201d and they will not appear in the attendance analytics for the class session. They will be placed at a table like all other learners and will get a notification of any audio changes, so they will know if they are speaking to the whole class or just their tablemates. If they would like to unmute to speak, they can press 2, and repeat to mute. If they would like to come to the Podium to be heard by the whole class, they can press 1, and repeat to lower their hand.\u00a0\n\nBest Practices\n\nIf you have a camera-on policy for your classroom, consider making an allowance for dial-in users, as they will not have the ability to be camera-on.\n\nEnsure you communicate group engagement guidelines, such as when and how you'd like learners to unmute and speak, raise their hands, or when they need to stay muted during presentations of content, direct instruction, videos, etc.\n\nDial-in users will not have a displayed name. To ensure that you provide attendance credit or know who is in attendance, we recommend asking all users to introduce themselves by unmuting and sharing their names and pronouns. You or your staff can document your dial-in users' names in the Notes for future reference.\n\nSet aside 1-2 minutes during table-based activities for learners to introduce themselves at their tables. Assign one group manager or representative to take notes or adds ideas from dial-in users to Whiteboards or shared Google/Microsoft 365 materials, so their contributions are included.\n\nRecord your sessions so that dial-in users can return to the recording in the Playback Room and engage in interactive components such as Polls, Whiteboards, Google/Microsoft 365 materials.\n\nHow dial-in learners appear in the Class Gallery\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0Need more help?

{"url": "https://support.engageli.com/hc/en-us/articles/4411909731227-How-to-Set-Up-Your-Class-Roster-and-Assigned-Seating", "html": "How to Set Up Your Class Roster and Assigned Seating\n3 months ago Updated\nFollow\nNot yet followed by anyone\n\nWhy Upload Roster?\u00a0 Learners entering an Engageli classroom through your institution\u2019s Learning Management System do not need to be pre-added to the Engageli roster for classroom access. However, if we are not integrated with your institution\u2019s LMS or you want to use specific seating assignments during class, you will need to have a list of learners in the system.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nSetting Up Class Roster\n\n1. Navigate to the Engageli portal and find your classroom.\u00a0\n\n2. Under Details > Roster, upload a list of all learners, TAs, and instructors (including you!) in your class.\u00a0 You can add users individually (plus sign) or through bulk upload (paper with the plus sign - See more detailed instructions below).\u00a0\n\n3. If you are planning to pre-assign seating, you can also include the table number/name you want each student to sit at. See more detailed instructions below.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAdding Class Participants in Bulk\u00a0\n\n1. Bulk add using the .csv template.\n\n2. Click \u2018Samples and templates here\u2019, which will open the template as a Google Document.\u00a0\n\n3. Choose File > Make a copy. You can name this copy whatever you like.\u00a0\n\n4. Fill out the CSV file with a list of learners, instructors, and TAs who should be allowed to join this classroom.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n5. When finished, go to File > Download > Comma-separated values (.csv, current sheet) to save to your computer.\u00a0\n\n6. Upload this roster from your computer into the Roster tab of the Portal.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nAssigning Seats\u00a0\n\nOpen seating is the default, but sometimes it can be helpful to assign seats for certain times during the session. You can save multiple presets to use during different points in the class (e.g. start of class, activity time, quiz time). This allows you to easily \u2018move\u2019 learners into different pre-assigned groups, without having to use time during class creating them. You can assign learners to randomly-combined groups of select sizes (1-10 learners) at any time (see detailed instructions here).\n\n\u00a0\n\n1. Under Tables & Presets > Tables, start by customizing the names for each table (e.g., for project groups) if desired.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n2. Under Tables & Presets > Presets, Click \u2018Samples and templates here\u2019, which will open the template as a Google Document.\u00a0\n\n3. Choose File > Make a copy. You can name this copy whatever you like.\u00a0\n\n4. Add each learner\u2019s email and the table you want them added to upon joining.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nIn this example, we have placed three students in each project group. Upon login, they will automatically be placed at Project Group 1 Table and Project Group 2 Table. Please note: The tables in your .cvs file must match the names of tables you created in step two. If you did not rename tables, use \u201cTable 1\u201d, \u201cTable 2\u201d, as in the default labels.\n\n\u00a0\n\n5. When finished, go to File > Download > Comma-separated values (.csv, current sheet) to save to your computer.\u00a0\n\n6. Click \u2018Upload Preset\u2019\n\n7. Name the preset and add a description if helpful (ex: Group Activity - Use this preset when you start group activity).\u00a0\n\n8. Upload the preset by clicking Files.\n\n\u00a0\n\n9. Once presets have been uploaded, you will see a learner\u2019s assigned location for each preset saved next to their name in the roster tab.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nUsing Presets in the Classroom\u00a0\n\n1. Once in your Classroom, at the relevant time, go to Tables > Seating Arrangement > Apply Preset to apply the desired preset.\u00a0\n\n2. Throughout the class, you can choose different presets and Engageli will move learners automatically. You can learn more about table settings in class here and here.\u00a0\n\nClick to learn how to add a tag to your presentation to easily activate a table preset or put learners into a random table arrangement.\n\nRelated article:\n\nHow to Download Your Class Roster\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0Need more help?

Based on feedback from partners, we've improved the Engageli classroom to better support teaching and active learning and provide a flexible learning environment for all participants. In addition to a variety of new features, Engageli\u2019s team has enhanced the overall teaching and learning experience in many ways.\u00a0\n\nExciting New Features\nDial-in support (Beta)\nFor U.S. customers only\nLearners without access to a computer or mobile app can dial into the classroom.\nLock Tables\u00a0\nInstructors can lock tables to stop learners from moving between tables to better manage their learners and class activities.\nPeek at Tables\nInstructors can now observe table activities unobtrusively without interrupting the learners.\nTwo Instructors Using Web Browsers\nTwo users on web browsers can act as instructors, as opposed to needing the instructor application as in previous versions.\nCollaboration Spaces\nNew Playback Room features allow for collaboration spaces where learners can review course material and complete assignments and supplemental material in groups.\nSelf-Paced Assignments\nEngageli\u2019s self-paced materials have been enhanced to allow completion tracking and customized tasks that can be completed individually or in groups.\nMore New Features and Enhancements\n\nAccessibility\n\nUsers with the TA or instructor role can provide manual captions.\u00a0\nInstructors can manually replace transcribed captioning files. Learners with accommodation may need additional help via transcription in the Playback Room.

At the beginning of class when learners are entering the classroom, you can engage in community-building chat and general check-ins in Room Mode.\n\n2. After a table-based or group-based discussion/activity that was conducted in Table Mode, you can use this tag to shift back to Room Mode and have an all-class discussion/debrief.\n\nPro Tip! Have learners use the \u201cRaise Hand\u201d button when speaking to the whole class, so all learners see the individual who is speaking.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIn Table Mode:\n\nThe instructor does not hear learners seated at tables who are unmuted and speaking.\nThe instructor hears learners who are speaking on the podium.\nLearners hear the instructor, their tablemates, and other learners with their hands raised.\n\nIf you or a co-instructor joins a table, Engageli automatically switches to Table Mode (to prevent any table-based or private discussion from being shared with learners at other tables).\n\nWhen to Use\n\n1. You could have the table mode tag on one of your first few slides, as we recommend shifting to Table Mode early in your class session:\n\nYou can convey content without audio disruption from learners who might be unmuted accidentally.\nLearners can easily interact with the instructor and full class by raising their hands.\nLearners are able to \u201clean over\u201d and ask their tablemates questions without interrupting.\u00a0\nWhen table activities start, there is no change needed, and learners can just begin working.\nYou can easily either unmute the gallery OR join/observe tables without having to also remember to change audio modes.\n\n2. You could also have this slide present right before a table-based/group-based activity, to prompt a shift to Table Mode.\n\nTo use the Action Tags Lab for Table mode:\n\nGo to the Action Tags Lab in the Admin portal.\u00a0\nSelect Room mode. Select Audio Mode if you're using Engageli 3.0.\nSelect a tag for either room mode or table mode.\nProvide a name for your tag if you want.\u00a0\nCopy the tag to paste it into a document or slide.\nOr, download a copy of the tag to insert in a document or slide.\u00a0\n\nWhen the tag is detected in your document or slide, you\u2019ll receive a notification.\n\nClick here to learn more about Engageli\u2019s audio settings.\u00a0\n\nClick here to learn about automating the detection of your tag.\n\nCopy/paste or download the audio mode tags below to get started.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0Need more help?

Room Mode captures all audio in the classroom.\u00a0\nDiscussions that happen at the tables when Table Mode is enabled are not recorded.\n\nTables and Group Activities\u00a0\n\nIf you are doing group activities, and are visiting tables, the recording will not pause automatically. If you are conducting group activities within the tables, you should pause the recording until you regroup so that there is no blank air time.\u00a0\n\nCollaborative Features\n\nIf you run a poll during your class, as an ice breaker or to check for understanding, learners watching the recording can also participate in the poll. After you turn on the poll, the poll will be displayed in the recording. If you want asynchronous learners to see the live results, click \"Share Results\" in the live session. Asynchronous learners will need to answer the poll before seeing the live results.\nAny questions posted in the Q&A during the live class will be displayed in the Playback Room. Learners watching the recording can answer the same questions that were posed in the live session.

This is great for brainstorming sessions, in-class group assignments, worksheets, or presentation preparation.\n\nNote: This feature is best used for files that you want learners to edit together in class. If you wish to simply share notes, presentations, or other files with the class, it is best to upload the file in the Chat. A comprehensive guide on how to use the chat can be found here.\n\nClass Document and Table Documents\nDistribute Documents in Class\nPrepare Shared Table Documents in the Admin Portal\nClass Document and Table Documents\n\nYou distribute two kinds of documents in Engageli: a class document or table documents.\n\nA class document is a file that opens for the entire class to view and edit directly on the Engageli screen.\n\nWhen to use: You can use this feature to distribute a file to learners to collaborate in real-time for full class contributions/activities.\n\nA table document is a file that opens for a particular table. You can have the same file open or different files for different tables.\n\nWhen to use: You can use this feature to distribute a file to learners to collaborate in real-time on table-based activities, peer-to-peer instruction, station-based work, case studies per table, etc. You can distribute:\nOne document shared with all tables\nIndividual documents shared per table\n\nFor either a class document or separate table documents, you can share the following types of files:\n\nGoogle Document, Sheet, and Slides\nMicrosoft 365 Word, Excel, and Powerpoint\n\nNote: Microsoft 365 files open within Engageli in view-only mode. For editing, the files will open in a new tab.\n\nDistribute Documents in Class\n\nYou can distribute documents in class without any prior setup.\n\n1. Start your class.\n\n2. When you are ready to distribute the documents, click the Present button at the bottom of the screen.\n\n3. Select either Distribute Doc or Distribute Docs.\n\n4. For a classroom doc, paste the link to the file you want to share and then click the Share button.\n\n5. For table documents, select the set of files you want to share if you added them to the Admin Portal before class, or click the plus sign to add the links.\n\nNote: You have to add links for each table, even if it\u2019s the same file for each table.\n\nPro tip! Save time by adding table document links to the Admin Portal before class. Add them in the Materials section. At this time, shared class document links cannot be added beforehand, only shared table documents.\n\n6. Learners will then see the document you have shared and be able to edit directly on the documents.\u00a0\n\nYou can change the links to be shared at any point during the class.\n\nAfter enabling a shared doc, you will see a prompt to change the classroom audio to Table Mode.\n\n7. When you are ready to collect the documents, click the Present button again, and then Stop. After clicking, learners will no longer be able to see or edit the document.\n\nPrepare Shared Table Documents\u00a0in the Admin Portal\n\n1. Go to the Admin Portal.\n\n2.

You can distribute one document per table. Learners seated at that table will be shown that document after activating the feature during class.\u00a0\n\n10. Confirm that the linked documents are made editable for/by your class before distributing them. You should do this directly in the Google file or Microsoft 365 file that you plan to share.\n\n\u00a0\n\nGoogle Suite Microsoft 365\n.\u00a0 \n\n\u00a0Need more help?

Playback Rooms are open 24/7 and learners can use them to create online collaborative spaces and complete the assigned tasks together.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAccessing the Playback Room\n\nYou can access the Playback Room directly from the same link that you use for your live Engageli classes.\u00a0\n\n1. Open the classroom URL and select Playback room at the top of the screen.\n\n2. Then, click Start my Playback room.\u00a0\n\nCreate a Collaboration Space for My Group\n\nThe first step for creating a Collaboration Space is to get the invite link for your Playback room.\u00a0\n\n1. In your Playback room, click By Invitation in the bottom left corner.\n\n2. Click Copy invite link.\u00a0\n\nYou can send the link to your peers as well as guests.\n\n\u00a0\n\nInstructions for Engageli 3.41: The first step for creating a Collaboration Space is to create a permanent link for the Playback room.\u00a0\n\n1.

Once the Permanent Link is created, you can copy it to share with your peers as well as guests.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0Create a Collaboration Space for Anyone to Join\n\nBy default, Playback rooms are set to Private, which means that a user needs a guest link from the room in order to join. If set to Open (or Public Mode), your Playback room appears on the login screen for your classmates and peers and they will be able to join without a guest link.\n\nTo set the room to Open:\n\n1. Click By invitation in the bottom left corner.\u00a0\n\n2. Select Open.\u00a0\n\nIn Engageli 3.1.41, to set the room to Public Mode, select Private Mode in the bottom left corner and then switch to Public Mode.\n\nThis is how public Playback rooms appear to users.\u00a0\n\nAs the host who started the group, you will retain the playback controls.

Browser-based instructors should click here for instructions.\nThere are many ways to track engagement in Engageli, for individual learners as well as the entire class. These markers can help you keep a pulse on how the class is engaging with and learning the content so you can adjust as needed.\n\n\u00a0\n\nClass Engagement\n\nIndividual Engagement Markers\n\n\u00a0\n\nClass Engagement\n\n(Note: At this time, class markers are only available if you are teaching on the instructor application.)\n\n\u00a0\n\n1. Emojis: The Emoji Thermometer measures learner sentiment. Learners have four emoji options: red, orange, yellow, and green. As learners answer, the thermometer will move up and down. All answers are anonymous, so you will get the aggregate of the responses.\u00a0\n\nSome example questions to use with Emojis are:\n\n\"How are you feeling today?\"\n\"How confident are you in the material we just covered?\"\n\n2. The Bowtie Thermometer measures aggregate class engagement. As learners interact with the platform, the engagement bar will move up and down.\u00a0\n\nExamples of platform engagement are: raising hands, chatting, asking questions in Q&A, answering polls/quizzes, giving thumbs up or down, etc.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIndividual Engagement Markers\n\nIn addition to tracking full class engagement with the engagement thermometers, you can also track individual learner engagement.\n\n\u00a0\n\n1. Thumbs up/thumbs down: You can ask learners to give you a thumbs up or down. Everyone will see the thumbs appear instantly on the screen, but only instructors and TAs will see individual thumbs up/thumbs down on the learners' video feeds in the Class Gallery.\n\nThumbs up or down can be used to get quick feedback, check understanding, or check if learners are paying attention. Some example questions to use with thumbs are:\n\n\"Do you understand the material we just covered?\"\n\"Give me a thumbs up if you can see my screen.\"\n\nPro Tip! Use thumbs up or down to check engagement for learners with their cameras off. When coming back after a break, if many learners turned off their cameras, ask for a thumbs up if learners are back and then look at the class gallery to see how many thumbs up there are.\n\n\u00a0 Engageli 3.0\u00a0\nIn Engageli 3.0, there are new reactions and sounds for learners and instructors. Click here to learn more.\n\n2. Green Dot marker\n\nEach learner has an engagement marker next to their video feed on the gallery view of the instructor application.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe green dot marker represents when a learner is \"active,\" meaning that they have recently interacted in the classroom in some way. The green dot resets to the maximum size (5) each time a learner does one of the following:\n\nWrites a question or answer in Q&A\nResponds to a poll question\nRaises a hand\nShares screen with their table\nShares screen with their class\nUses thumbs up/down\nUses emojis\nInitiates audio activity (speaking, unmuting microphone)\n\nNote: The green marker decays and appears smaller after some time. The decay is linear, from maximum (5) to minimum (0) over three minutes. Hovering over the indicator in a learner\u2019s video feed shows an engagement value out of 5 (Engagement - 5/5). Any form of activity listed above will turn the marker green.\n\nThe gray dot marker replaces the green markers when a learner who was previously active has not recently interacted in the classroom. In general, a green marker will turn gray after three minutes. The gray marker corresponds to an Engagement rating of 0/5.\nNo marker simply means the learner has not interacted in the classroom at any point.\nThe perforated (dotted) marker indicates that a learner who was seated at a table has left the class. They are still represented in the class by what's called a reservation, as explained in this article.\n\nYou can also see the green dot marker in the LISTS view.\n\n\u00a0\n\n3. Table Engagement\n\nIn addition to the learner\u2019s video feed and LISTS view, the individual engagement markers trigger an engagement indication at the table level, which you can see in the TABLES view.\n\nSimilar to the green dot marker, the green table ring decays and fades away after some time due to inactivity. The decay is linear, from maximum (5) to minimum (0) over three minutes.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0Need more help?

Tables are built so learners will always be in small groups and you do not need to create breakout rooms for group activities. This allows you to create rich learning experiences at the tables while learners also feel simultaneously connected to the larger class and the instructor.\n\n\u00a0\n\nJoining Tables\n\nCreating Random Tables Groups\u00a0\n\nMoving learners to different Tables\n\n\u00a0\n\nJoining Tables\n\nJoining tables allows you to leave the podium and \u201cvisit\u201d groups of learners at tables, much like \u201cwalking the room\u201d in an in-person class. This is great for any group work or discussions.\n\nInstructions\n1. To join a table, click the Tables tab.\n2. Hover over the table that you'd like to join and click the JOIN button.\n\nWhen you join the table, you will see, hear, and interact only with members of the table you joined. This is great when groups have a question on an in-class assignment and you don't want to interrupt the entire class.\n\n3. When you are ready to leave the table, click the Back to podium button. Engageli 3.1 users have several options for returning to the podium.\n\nNote: The audio will automatically switch from Room Mode to Table Mode. When you leave the table, you will have to switch the audio setting back to Room Mode to enable a full-class discussion. Click to learn more about the audio settings.\n\nNew in Engageli 3.1!\n\nIn Engageli 3.1, instructors will peek at or observe tables unobtrusively without disturbing the learners.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nCreating Random Tables Groups\u00a0\n\nThis is a great way to encourage learner engagement is to randomly arrange table groups for discussions.\u00a0\n\nInstructions\n\n1. Go to the Seating Arrangement drop-down menu in the Tables view.\u00a0\n\n2. Select Random Arrangement Table Size.\n\n3. Choose the number of learners you would like at each table. The system will automatically break learners into randomized groups.\n\nYou can also reserve any of the first 3 tables for staff or other participants who you don't want to move during the random arrangement. In Engageli 3.0, this is called Skip Tables.\n\nNote: If learners have a reservation, then they will be treated as learners. Make sure to remove any reservations before you do this! (See instructions on reservations here).\n\nYou can save the table arrangement you created as a preset that you can use again. Click for information on how to create a table preset during a class.\n\n\u00a0\n\nMoving Learners to Different Tables\u00a0\n\nInstructions\n1. Navigate to the Tables view.\n2. Click the profile icon of the learner you wish to move.\n\n3. Choose a new table for the learner from the drop-down menu.\n\n4. Or, you can simply drag and drop the learner to a different table.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0Need more help?

At the beginning of class when learners are entering the classroom, you can engage in community-building chat and general check-ins in Room Mode.\n\n2. After a table-based or group-based discussion/activity that was conducted in Table Mode, you can use this tag to shift back to Room Mode and have an all-class discussion/debrief.\n\nPro Tip! Have learners use the \u201cRaise Hand\u201d button when speaking to the whole class, so all learners see the individual who is speaking.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIn Table Mode:\n\nThe instructor does not hear learners seated at tables who are unmuted and speaking.\nThe instructor hears learners who are speaking on the podium.\nLearners hear the instructor, their tablemates, and other learners with their hands raised.\n\nIf you or a co-instructor joins a table, Engageli automatically switches to Table Mode (to prevent any table-based or private discussion from being shared with learners at other tables).\n\nWhen to Use\n\n1. You could have the table mode tag on one of your first few slides, as we recommend shifting to Table Mode early in your class session:\n\nYou can convey content without audio disruption from learners who might be unmuted accidentally.\nLearners can easily interact with the instructor and full class by raising their hands.\nLearners are able to \u201clean over\u201d and ask their tablemates questions without interrupting.\u00a0\nWhen table activities start, there is no change needed, and learners can just begin working.\nYou can easily either unmute the gallery OR join/observe tables without having to also remember to change audio modes.\n\n2. You could also have this slide present right before a table-based/group-based activity, to prompt a shift to Table Mode.\n\nTo use the Action Tags Lab for Table mode:\n\nGo to the Action Tags Lab in the Admin portal.\u00a0\nSelect Room mode. Select Audio Mode if you're using Engageli 3.0.\nSelect a tag for either room mode or table mode.\nProvide a name for your tag if you want.\u00a0\nCopy the tag to paste it into a document or slide.\nOr, download a copy of the tag to insert in a document or slide.\u00a0\n\nWhen the tag is detected in your document or slide, you\u2019ll receive a notification.\n\nClick here to learn more about Engageli\u2019s audio settings.\u00a0\n\nClick here to learn about automating the detection of your tag.\n\nCopy/paste or download the audio mode tags below to get started.\n\n\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0Need more help?

Move each panelist into a panel by hovering over their video feed and selecting \u00a0Add to Panel.\u00a0At this time, you must add each learner individually.\n\nThe panelists you have moved will appear in the primary view for all students.

Click to understand more about Room Mode and Table Mode and how to effectively use Engageli's audio modes to foster active learning and collaboration.\u00a0\n\nEngageli now has two main audio modes, Room Mode and Table Mode.\n\nRoom Mode:\n\nThis is the default when you enter your Engageli classroom. This means that as the instructor you will hear the audio feeds from all learners, and they will hear each other, regardless of where they are seated.\n\nWhen to use: the beginning of class, or entire classroom discussions\n\n\u00a0\n\nTable Mode:\n\nWhen you enable Table Mode, learners will hear only their table mates and you will only hear learners who raise their hands.\u00a0\n\nWhen to use: small group discussions, projects, and other table activities\n\n\u00a0\n\nYou can easily toggle between the two modes from the bottom right corner of the screen.\n\n\u00a0 \n\nIf you or a co-instructor join a table, Engageli automatically switches to Table Mode. When at a table, you will only hear the learners at that table (and any learners at other tables that raise their hands).\u00a0 While an instructor is at a table, no instructor will be able to change the mode to Room Mode.\u00a0\n\nFor learners, the tablemates panel will automatically close when switching the audio mode to Room mode from the Table audio mode so learners direct their attention back to the class.\n\nIf you would like to hear all the learners concurrently while at the podium in Table Mode, click on the three dots and choose \u2018Hear tables while on podium in table mode\u2019.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nYou can hover over the Table Mode and Room Mode buttons to see who you can hear and who can hear you.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: All audio will be recorded in Room Mode and only those on podium (learners with hands raised or instructor(s)) will be recorded in Table Mode.\n\n\u00a0\n\nClick to learn how to add a tag to your presentation for a reminder to switch between Room Mode and Table Mode.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0Need more help?

You could have the table mode tag on one of your first few slides, as we recommend shifting to Table Mode early in your class session:\n\nYou can convey content without audio disruption from learners who might be unmuted accidentally.\nLearners can easily interact with the instructor and full class by raising their hands.\nLearners are able to \u201clean over\u201d and ask their tablemates questions without interrupting.\u00a0\nWhen table activities start, there is no change needed, and learners can just begin working.\nYou can easily either unmute the gallery OR join/observe tables without having to also remember to change audio modes.\n\n2.

{"url": "https://support.engageli.com/hc/en-us/articles/4411909731227-How-to-Set-Up-Your-Class-Roster-and-Assigned-Seating", "html": "How to Set Up Your Class Roster and Assigned Seating\n3 months ago Updated\nFollow\nNot yet followed by anyone\n\nWhy Upload Roster?\u00a0 Learners entering an Engageli classroom through your institution\u2019s Learning Management System do not need to be pre-added to the Engageli roster for classroom access. However, if we are not integrated with your institution\u2019s LMS or you want to use specific seating assignments during class, you will need to have a list of learners in the system.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nSetting Up Class Roster\n\n1. Navigate to the Engageli portal and find your classroom.\u00a0\n\n2. Under Details > Roster, upload a list of all learners, TAs, and instructors (including you!) in your class.\u00a0 You can add users individually (plus sign) or through bulk upload (paper with the plus sign - See more detailed instructions below).\u00a0\n\n3. If you are planning to pre-assign seating, you can also include the table number/name you want each student to sit at. See more detailed instructions below.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAdding Class Participants in Bulk\u00a0\n\n1. Bulk add using the .csv template.\n\n2. Click \u2018Samples and templates here\u2019, which will open the template as a Google Document.\u00a0\n\n3. Choose File > Make a copy. You can name this copy whatever you like.\u00a0\n\n4. Fill out the CSV file with a list of learners, instructors, and TAs who should be allowed to join this classroom.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n5. When finished, go to File > Download > Comma-separated values (.csv, current sheet) to save to your computer.\u00a0\n\n6. Upload this roster from your computer into the Roster tab of the Portal.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nAssigning Seats\u00a0\n\nOpen seating is the default, but sometimes it can be helpful to assign seats for certain times during the session. You can save multiple presets to use during different points in the class (e.g. start of class, activity time, quiz time). This allows you to easily \u2018move\u2019 learners into different pre-assigned groups, without having to use time during class creating them. You can assign learners to randomly-combined groups of select sizes (1-10 learners) at any time (see detailed instructions here).\n\n\u00a0\n\n1. Under Tables & Presets > Tables, start by customizing the names for each table (e.g., for project groups) if desired.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n2. Under Tables & Presets > Presets, Click \u2018Samples and templates here\u2019, which will open the template as a Google Document.\u00a0\n\n3. Choose File > Make a copy. You can name this copy whatever you like.\u00a0\n\n4. Add each learner\u2019s email and the table you want them added to upon joining.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nIn this example, we have placed three students in each project group. Upon login, they will automatically be placed at Project Group 1 Table and Project Group 2 Table. Please note: The tables in your .cvs file must match the names of tables you created in step two. If you did not rename tables, use \u201cTable 1\u201d, \u201cTable 2\u201d, as in the default labels.\n\n\u00a0\n\n5. When finished, go to File > Download > Comma-separated values (.csv, current sheet) to save to your computer.\u00a0\n\n6. Click \u2018Upload Preset\u2019\n\n7. Name the preset and add a description if helpful (ex: Group Activity - Use this preset when you start group activity).\u00a0\n\n8. Upload the preset by clicking Files.\n\n\u00a0\n\n9. Once presets have been uploaded, you will see a learner\u2019s assigned location for each preset saved next to their name in the roster tab.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nUsing Presets in the Classroom\u00a0\n\n1. Once in your Classroom, at the relevant time, go to Tables > Seating Arrangement > Apply Preset to apply the desired preset.\u00a0\n\n2. Throughout the class, you can choose different presets and Engageli will move learners automatically. You can learn more about table settings in class here and here.\u00a0\n\nClick to learn how to add a tag to your presentation to easily activate a table preset or put learners into a random table arrangement.\n\nRelated article:\n\nHow to Download Your Class Roster\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0Need more help?

Tables are built so learners will always be in small groups and you do not need to create breakout rooms for group activities. This allows you to create rich learning experiences at the tables while learners also feel simultaneously connected to the larger class and the instructor.\n\n\u00a0\n\nJoining Tables\n\nCreating Random Tables Groups\u00a0\n\nMoving learners to different Tables\n\n\u00a0\n\nJoining Tables\n\nJoining tables allows you to leave the podium and \u201cvisit\u201d groups of learners at tables, much like \u201cwalking the room\u201d in an in-person class. This is great for any group work or discussions.\n\nInstructions\n1. To join a table, click the Tables tab.\n2. Hover over the table that you'd like to join and click the JOIN button.\n\nWhen you join the table, you will see, hear, and interact only with members of the table you joined. This is great when groups have a question on an in-class assignment and you don't want to interrupt the entire class.\n\n3. When you are ready to leave the table, click the Back to podium button. Engageli 3.1 users have several options for returning to the podium.\n\nNote: The audio will automatically switch from Room Mode to Table Mode. When you leave the table, you will have to switch the audio setting back to Room Mode to enable a full-class discussion. Click to learn more about the audio settings.\n\nNew in Engageli 3.1!\n\nIn Engageli 3.1, instructors will peek at or observe tables unobtrusively without disturbing the learners.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nCreating Random Tables Groups\u00a0\n\nThis is a great way to encourage learner engagement is to randomly arrange table groups for discussions.\u00a0\n\nInstructions\n\n1. Go to the Seating Arrangement drop-down menu in the Tables view.\u00a0\n\n2. Select Random Arrangement Table Size.\n\n3. Choose the number of learners you would like at each table. The system will automatically break learners into randomized groups.\n\nYou can also reserve any of the first 3 tables for staff or other participants who you don't want to move during the random arrangement. In Engageli 3.0, this is called Skip Tables.\n\nNote: If learners have a reservation, then they will be treated as learners. Make sure to remove any reservations before you do this! (See instructions on reservations here).\n\nYou can save the table arrangement you created as a preset that you can use again. Click for information on how to create a table preset during a class.\n\n\u00a0\n\nMoving Learners to Different Tables\u00a0\n\nInstructions\n1. Navigate to the Tables view.\n2. Click the profile icon of the learner you wish to move.\n\n3. Choose a new table for the learner from the drop-down menu.\n\n4. Or, you can simply drag and drop the learner to a different table.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0Need more help?

Browser-based instructors should click here for instructions.\nThere are many ways to track engagement in Engageli, for individual learners as well as the entire class. These markers can help you keep a pulse on how the class is engaging with and learning the content so you can adjust as needed.\n\n\u00a0\n\nClass Engagement\n\nIndividual Engagement Markers\n\n\u00a0\n\nClass Engagement\n\n(Note: At this time, class markers are only available if you are teaching on the instructor application.)\n\n\u00a0\n\n1. Emojis: The Emoji Thermometer measures learner sentiment. Learners have four emoji options: red, orange, yellow, and green. As learners answer, the thermometer will move up and down. All answers are anonymous, so you will get the aggregate of the responses.\u00a0\n\nSome example questions to use with Emojis are:\n\n\"How are you feeling today?\"\n\"How confident are you in the material we just covered?\"\n\n2. The Bowtie Thermometer measures aggregate class engagement. As learners interact with the platform, the engagement bar will move up and down.\u00a0\n\nExamples of platform engagement are: raising hands, chatting, asking questions in Q&A, answering polls/quizzes, giving thumbs up or down, etc.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIndividual Engagement Markers\n\nIn addition to tracking full class engagement with the engagement thermometers, you can also track individual learner engagement.\n\n\u00a0\n\n1. Thumbs up/thumbs down: You can ask learners to give you a thumbs up or down. Everyone will see the thumbs appear instantly on the screen, but only instructors and TAs will see individual thumbs up/thumbs down on the learners' video feeds in the Class Gallery.\n\nThumbs up or down can be used to get quick feedback, check understanding, or check if learners are paying attention. Some example questions to use with thumbs are:\n\n\"Do you understand the material we just covered?\"\n\"Give me a thumbs up if you can see my screen.\"\n\nPro Tip! Use thumbs up or down to check engagement for learners with their cameras off. When coming back after a break, if many learners turned off their cameras, ask for a thumbs up if learners are back and then look at the class gallery to see how many thumbs up there are.\n\n\u00a0 Engageli 3.0\u00a0\nIn Engageli 3.0, there are new reactions and sounds for learners and instructors. Click here to learn more.\n\n2. Green Dot marker\n\nEach learner has an engagement marker next to their video feed on the gallery view of the instructor application.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThe green dot marker represents when a learner is \"active,\" meaning that they have recently interacted in the classroom in some way. The green dot resets to the maximum size (5) each time a learner does one of the following:\n\nWrites a question or answer in Q&A\nResponds to a poll question\nRaises a hand\nShares screen with their table\nShares screen with their class\nUses thumbs up/down\nUses emojis\nInitiates audio activity (speaking, unmuting microphone)\n\nNote: The green marker decays and appears smaller after some time. The decay is linear, from maximum (5) to minimum (0) over three minutes. Hovering over the indicator in a learner\u2019s video feed shows an engagement value out of 5 (Engagement - 5/5). Any form of activity listed above will turn the marker green.\n\nThe gray dot marker replaces the green markers when a learner who was previously active has not recently interacted in the classroom. In general, a green marker will turn gray after three minutes. The gray marker corresponds to an Engagement rating of 0/5.\nNo marker simply means the learner has not interacted in the classroom at any point.\nThe perforated (dotted) marker indicates that a learner who was seated at a table has left the class. They are still represented in the class by what's called a reservation, as explained in this article.\n\nYou can also see the green dot marker in the LISTS view.\n\n\u00a0\n\n3. Table Engagement\n\nIn addition to the learner\u2019s video feed and LISTS view, the individual engagement markers trigger an engagement indication at the table level, which you can see in the TABLES view.\n\nSimilar to the green dot marker, the green table ring decays and fades away after some time due to inactivity. The decay is linear, from maximum (5) to minimum (0) over three minutes.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0Need more help?

We currently do not support mobile or tablet devices. If a user is on one of these, instruct them to join via laptop, computer, or Chromebook.\nWhat browser are you using? We currently do not recommend Safari or Firefox browsers. If a user is on one of these, invite them to join Engageli via Chrome, Edge, or a browser on Chromium (Opera, Vivaldi, Brave).\nHave you tried refreshing the browser? If not, instruct the user to refresh the browser (log out and log back in). Simply taking this action can sometimes solve your problem.\u00a0\nDo you have an extension running that is blocking screen sharing? Check your extensions or 3rd party anti-virus software.\nDid your permissions get reset? Sometimes permissions are reset without any notification, so recheck your settings to make sure Engageli has permission to share and record your screen.\n\nIf none of this works, reach out to our Support team.\n\nYou can also use the PDF Live Share to share a presentation directly in Engageli without sharing your screen.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0Need more help?

This is applicable only to single-answer polls.\n\nWhen to use:\n\nIf most learners answer the same question correctly, it may not be worth the class time to discuss the results. If learners are split in their responses, invite them to discuss with other learners to probe for differences and clarify misconceptions. Use this feature to divide the learners into small groups. (You can even re-run the poll after learners discuss their responses with peers.)\nSplitting learners into table groups based on similar poll results can be a good way to help learners get to know each other during icebreakers, share a common interest, prepare group responses to discussion questions, group learners for projects based on topic interest or prepare for debates conducted via a Panel Discussion.\n\nSplit learners based on poll results during the poll:\n\nInstructions\n\nRun the poll in your shared presentation or PDF.\nClick Start Poll Split.\nSelect whether you want to split learners by Diverse or Common responses.\nUse the slider to the maximum number of learners you want at each table. (TAs won\u2019t be moved to a different table.)\nUse the slider to choose the number of learners per table.\nIf you want to reserve [skip in Engageli 3.0] or set aside certain tables, use the slider to select the tables.\nClick Split [Confirm in Engageli 3.0].\n\nLearners can be split into groups of 1-10 learners, depending on the number of seats at each table. Click here to learn how to change the number of seats at a table. Click here to learn more about skipping tables during the split-by-poll arrangement.\n\nNote: In situations where learners do not answer the poll question, they are considered as if the poll has an additional answer possibility (i.e., \u201cdid not want to answer\u201d), and will be split into table groups based on dissimilar responses.\n\nYou can also split learners based on poll results at any point during the class from the Tables Tab.

However, if we are not integrated with your institution\u2019s LMS or you want to use specific seating assignments during class, you will need to have a list of learners in the system.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nSetting Up Class Roster\n\n1. Navigate to the Engageli portal and find your classroom.\u00a0\n\n2. Under Details > Roster, upload a list of all learners, TAs, and instructors (including you!) in your class.\u00a0 You can add users individually (plus sign) or through bulk upload (paper with the plus sign - See more detailed instructions below).\u00a0\n\n3. If you are planning to pre-assign seating, you can also include the table number/name you want each student to sit at. See more detailed instructions below.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAdding Class Participants in Bulk\u00a0\n\n1. Bulk add using the .csv template.\n\n2. Click \u2018Samples and templates here\u2019, which will open the template as a Google Document.\u00a0\n\n3. Choose File > Make a copy. You can name this copy whatever you like.\u00a0\n\n4. Fill out the CSV file with a list of learners, instructors, and TAs who should be allowed to join this classroom.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n5. When finished, go to File > Download > Comma-separated values (.csv, current sheet) to save to your computer.\u00a0\n\n6. Upload this roster from your computer into the Roster tab of the Portal.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nAssigning Seats\u00a0\n\nOpen seating is the default, but sometimes it can be helpful to assign seats for certain times during the session. You can save multiple presets to use during different points in the class (e.g. start of class, activity time, quiz time). This allows you to easily \u2018move\u2019 learners into different pre-assigned groups, without having to use time during class creating them. You can assign learners to randomly-combined groups of select sizes (1-10 learners) at any time (see detailed instructions here).\n\n\u00a0\n\n1. Under Tables & Presets > Tables, start by customizing the names for each table (e.g., for project groups) if desired.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n2. Under Tables & Presets > Presets, Click \u2018Samples and templates here\u2019, which will open the template as a Google Document.\u00a0\n\n3. Choose File > Make a copy. You can name this copy whatever you like.\u00a0\n\n4. Add each learner\u2019s email and the table you want them added to upon joining.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nIn this example, we have placed three students in each project group. Upon login, they will automatically be placed at Project Group 1 Table and Project Group 2 Table. Please note: The tables in your .cvs file must match the names of tables you created in step two. If you did not rename tables, use \u201cTable 1\u201d, \u201cTable 2\u201d, as in the default labels.\n\n\u00a0\n\n5. When finished, go to File > Download > Comma-separated values (.csv, current sheet) to save to your computer.\u00a0\n\n6. Click \u2018Upload Preset\u2019\n\n7. Name the preset and add a description if helpful (ex: Group Activity - Use this preset when you start group activity).\u00a0\n\n8. Upload the preset by clicking Files.\n\n\u00a0\n\n9. Once presets have been uploaded, you will see a learner\u2019s assigned location for each preset saved next to their name in the roster tab.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nUsing Presets in the Classroom\u00a0\n\n1. Once in your Classroom, at the relevant time, go to Tables > Seating Arrangement > Apply Preset to apply the desired preset.\u00a0\n\n2. Throughout the class, you can choose different presets and Engageli will move learners automatically. You can learn more about table settings in class here and here.\u00a0\n\nClick to learn how to add a tag to your presentation to easily activate a table preset or put learners into a random table arrangement.\n\nRelated article:\n\nHow to Download Your Class Roster\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0Need more help?

At the beginning of class when learners are entering the classroom, you can engage in community-building chat and general check-ins in Room Mode.\n\n2. After a table-based or group-based discussion/activity that was conducted in Table Mode, you can use this tag to shift back to Room Mode and have an all-class discussion/debrief.\n\nPro Tip! Have learners use the \u201cRaise Hand\u201d button when speaking to the whole class, so all learners see the individual who is speaking.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIn Table Mode:\n\nThe instructor does not hear learners seated at tables who are unmuted and speaking.\nThe instructor hears learners who are speaking on the podium.\nLearners hear the instructor, their tablemates, and other learners with their hands raised.\n\nIf you or a co-instructor joins a table, Engageli automatically switches to Table Mode (to prevent any table-based or private discussion from being shared with learners at other tables).\n\nWhen to Use\n\n1. You could have the table mode tag on one of your first few slides, as we recommend shifting to Table Mode early in your class session:\n\nYou can convey content without audio disruption from learners who might be unmuted accidentally.\nLearners can easily interact with the instructor and full class by raising their hands.\nLearners are able to \u201clean over\u201d and ask their tablemates questions without interrupting.\u00a0\nWhen table activities start, there is no change needed, and learners can just begin working.\nYou can easily either unmute the gallery OR join/observe tables without having to also remember to change audio modes.\n\n2. You could also have this slide present right before a table-based/group-based activity, to prompt a shift to Table Mode.\n\nTo use the Action Tags Lab for Table mode:\n\nGo to the Action Tags Lab in the Admin portal.\u00a0\nSelect Room mode.

Playback Rooms are open 24/7 and learners can use them to create online collaborative spaces and complete the assigned tasks together.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAccessing the Playback Room\n\nYou can access the Playback Room directly from the same link that you use for your live Engageli classes.\u00a0\n\n1. Open the classroom URL and select Playback room at the top of the screen.\n\n2. Then, click Start my Playback room.\u00a0\n\nCreate a Collaboration Space for My Group\n\nThe first step for creating a Collaboration Space is to get the invite link for your Playback room.\u00a0\n\n1. In your Playback room, click By Invitation in the bottom left corner.\n\n2. Click Copy invite link.\u00a0\n\nYou can send the link to your peers as well as guests.\n\n\u00a0\n\nInstructions for Engageli 3.41: The first step for creating a Collaboration Space is to create a permanent link for the Playback room.\u00a0\n\n1. In your Playback Room, click the Invite & Info icon in the bottom left corner.\n\n2. Click Create Permanent Link.\u00a0\n\n3. Once the Permanent Link is created, you can copy it to share with your peers as well as guests.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0Create a Collaboration Space for Anyone to Join\n\nBy default, Playback rooms are set to Private, which means that a user needs a guest link from the room in order to join. If set to Open (or Public Mode), your Playback room appears on the login screen for your classmates and peers and they will be able to join without a guest link.\n\nTo set the room to Open:\n\n1. Click By invitation in the bottom left corner.\u00a0\n\n2.

Instructors can use this data to track engagement during their sessions and answer questions such as:\n\nWhich learners are participating in the session (and which are not)?\nAm I, as the instructor, actively involving my learners in the session by asking questions, soliciting feedback, and asking them to share?\n\nChat Analytics\n\nChats can make virtual learning more efficient as questions are answered in real-time in context with instruction. Chat messages increase opportunities for learner-to-learner collaboration, as well as learner-to-instructor interaction. Chat also allows learners who are not able to turn on their microphone or camera to still actively participate in class by sending messages, uploading materials, collaborating with their tablemates, and engaging in community-building or other learning activities.\n\nA classroom with a larger percentage of messages sent to tablemates rather than private, 1-on-1 messages could reflect strong collaboration among the learners.\n\nPoll Analytics\n\nPolls can be presented in the course material as checks for comprehension and engagement in real-time. Using polls provides instructors an opportunity to adjust the pace of the class and can foster a discussion about the results in an effort to make the material more understandable. Polls also allow learners who are not able to turn on their microphone or camera to participate in checks for understanding or community-building polls, which can be used to determine learning gains, engagement, and if individual attention is required.\n\nPoll participation can indicate learner sentiment about instructional pedagogies used during the class.\n\nSpeak Time Analytics\n\nSpeak time is an important element of learning. Not only does talking help learners process the information presented during a lesson, it also promotes peer-to-peer learning and builds connections and community. Opportunities for table discussion (private to the table and never recorded) provide learners psychological safety and time to reflect and collaborate on the concepts presented. Interlacing class time with group activities at tables can provide structured ways for learners to practice critical thinking and reflect on the content presented.\n\nMeasuring learner speak time helps instructors understand the participation equity of learners in the class. It can also help instructors redesign their class session plans by incorporating additional time for group activities to increase speaking time and overall engagement in the classroom.\n\nReviewing the total learner speaking time vs instructor speaking time can help determine the proportion of direct instruction during a class.\n\nAttendance Analytics\n\nResearch shows that attendance is an important factor in learner achievement, as learners are more likely to succeed in academics when they attend class sessions consistently and are exposed to instruction.\n\nAttendance data can also be used to identify learners who are not attending and potentially falling behind, or who might need a success coach to reach out to ensure retention. Playback Room attendance data can be used to track whether absent or asynchronous learners review class recordings and engage with the course material and if follow-up attention is needed.\n\nGrades\n\nGrades allow instructors to evaluate learners and provide feedback on their work and performance.\n\nGrades recorded in Engageli can be used to identify learners who are falling behind, are having trouble with retention, or need individual support, supplemental instruction, or tutoring.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0Need more help?

These markers can help you keep a pulse on how the class is engaging with and learning the content so you can adjust as needed.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIndividual Engagement Markers\n\n1. Thumbs up/thumbs down\n\nYou can ask learners to use the reactions to give you a thumbs up or down. Everyone will see the thumbs appear instantly on the screen, but only instructors and TAs will see individual thumbs up/thumbs down on the learners' video feeds in the Class Gallery.\n\nThumbs up or down can be used to get quick feedback, check understanding, or check if learners are paying attention. Some example questions to use with thumbs are:\n\n\"Do you understand the material we just covered?\"\n\"Give me a thumbs up if you can see my screen.\"\n\nPro Tip! Use thumbs up or down to check engagement for learners with their cameras off. When coming back after a break, if many learners turned off their cameras, ask for a thumbs up if learners are back and then look at the class gallery to see how many thumbs up there are.\n\nThere are additional reactions and sounds for learners and instructors. Click here to learn more.\u00a0\n\n2. Green Dot Marker\n\nEach learner has an engagement marker in the bottom right corner of their video feed in the Class Gallery.\n\nThe green dot marker represents when a learner is \"active,\" meaning that they have recently interacted in the classroom in some way. The green dot resets to the maximum size (5) each time a learner does one of the following:\n\nWrites a question or answer in Q&A\nResponds to a poll question\nRaises hand\nLowers hand\nShares screen with their table\nShares screen with their class\nUses thumbs up/down\nUses other emojis reactions\nSends a chat message (private chats are not included)\nInitiates audio activity (speaking, unmuting microphone)\n\nNote: The green marker decays and appears smaller after some time. The decay is linear, from maximum (5) to minimum (0) over three minutes. Hovering over the indicator in a learner\u2019s video feed shows an engagement value out of 5 (Engagement - 5/5). Any form of activity listed above will turn the marker green.\n\nThe gray dot marker replaces the green markers when a learner who was previously active has not recently interacted in the classroom. In general, a green marker will turn gray after three minutes. The gray marker corresponds to an Engagement rating of 0/5.\n\nNo marker simply means the learner has not interacted in the classroom at any point.\n\nThe perforated (dotted) marker indicates that a learner who was seated at a table has left the class. They are still represented in the class by what's called a reservation, as explained in this article.\n\nYou can also see the green dot marker next to the learner's name in the List view in the Tables tab.\n\n\u00a0\n\nTable Engagement\n\nIn addition to the learner\u2019s video feed and the Lists view, the individual engagement markers trigger an engagement indication at the table level, which you can see in the Tables tab at the top of the screen.\n\nSimilar to the green dot marker, the green table ring decays and fades away after some time due to inactivity. The decay is linear, from maximum (5) to minimum (0) over three minutes.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0Need more help?

Room Mode captures all audio in the classroom.\u00a0\nDiscussions that happen at the tables when Table Mode is enabled are not recorded.\n\nTables and Group Activities\u00a0\n\nIf you are doing group activities, and are visiting tables, the recording will not pause automatically. If you are conducting group activities within the tables, you should pause the recording until you regroup so that there is no blank air time.\u00a0\n\nCollaborative Features\n\nIf you run a poll during your class, as an ice breaker or to check for understanding, learners watching the recording can also participate in the poll. After you turn on the poll, the poll will be displayed in the recording. If you want asynchronous learners to see the live results, click \"Share Results\" in the live session. Asynchronous learners will need to answer the poll before seeing the live results.\nAny questions posted in the Q&A during the live class will be displayed in the Playback Room. Learners watching the recording can answer the same questions that were posed in the live session. The questions will appear to any learner who attended, whether during the live session or viewing the recording in the Playback Room.\nMessages sent in the Chat are not included in the recording and do not persist in the Playback room.\nIf you distribute a Class or Table Whiteboard to learners during the session, these will be included in the recording.

{"url": "https://support.engageli.com/hc/en-us/articles/8562644617627-How-to-Track-Learner-Engagement-During-Class", "html": "How to Track Learner Engagement During Class\n1 month ago Updated\nFollow\nNot yet followed by anyone\n\nThere are many ways to track engagement in Engageli. These markers can help you keep a pulse on how the class is engaging with and learning the content so you can adjust as needed.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIndividual Engagement Markers\n\n1. Thumbs up/thumbs down\n\nYou can ask learners to use the reactions to give you a thumbs up or down. Everyone will see the thumbs appear instantly on the screen, but only instructors and TAs will see individual thumbs up/thumbs down on the learners' video feeds in the Class Gallery.\n\nThumbs up or down can be used to get quick feedback, check understanding, or check if learners are paying attention. Some example questions to use with thumbs are:\n\n\"Do you understand the material we just covered?\"\n\"Give me a thumbs up if you can see my screen.\"\n\nPro Tip! Use thumbs up or down to check engagement for learners with their cameras off. When coming back after a break, if many learners turned off their cameras, ask for a thumbs up if learners are back and then look at the class gallery to see how many thumbs up there are.\n\nThere are additional reactions and sounds for learners and instructors. Click here to learn more.\u00a0\n\n2. Green Dot Marker\n\nEach learner has an engagement marker in the bottom right corner of their video feed in the Class Gallery.\n\nThe green dot marker represents when a learner is \"active,\" meaning that they have recently interacted in the classroom in some way. The green dot resets to the maximum size (5) each time a learner does one of the following:\n\nWrites a question or answer in Q&A\nResponds to a poll question\nRaises hand\nLowers hand\nShares screen with their table\nShares screen with their class\nUses thumbs up/down\nUses other emojis reactions\nSends a chat message (private chats are not included)\nInitiates audio activity (speaking, unmuting microphone)\n\nNote: The green marker decays and appears smaller after some time. The decay is linear, from maximum (5) to minimum (0) over three minutes. Hovering over the indicator in a learner\u2019s video feed shows an engagement value out of 5 (Engagement - 5/5). Any form of activity listed above will turn the marker green.\n\nThe gray dot marker replaces the green markers when a learner who was previously active has not recently interacted in the classroom. In general, a green marker will turn gray after three minutes. The gray marker corresponds to an Engagement rating of 0/5.\n\nNo marker simply means the learner has not interacted in the classroom at any point.\n\nThe perforated (dotted) marker indicates that a learner who was seated at a table has left the class. They are still represented in the class by what's called a reservation, as explained in this article.\n\nYou can also see the green dot marker next to the learner's name in the List view in the Tables tab.\n\n\u00a0\n\nTable Engagement\n\nIn addition to the learner\u2019s video feed and the Lists view, the individual engagement markers trigger an engagement indication at the table level, which you can see in the Tables tab at the top of the screen.\n\nSimilar to the green dot marker, the green table ring decays and fades away after some time due to inactivity. The decay is linear, from maximum (5) to minimum (0) over three minutes.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0Need more help?

However, you will be able to share browser tabs.\n\n\u00a0\n\nYou should now be able to share your screen with the class, but if you are still having trouble you should answer the following questions:\n\n\u00a0\n\n1. What device are you using? We currently do not support mobile or tablet devices. If a user is on one of these, instruct them to join via laptop, computer, or Chromebook.\n\n2. Do you have 3rd party anti-virus software that is blocking screen sharing? Check your 3rd party anti-virus software.\n\n3. Did your permissions get reset? Sometimes permissions are reset without any notification, so recheck your settings to make sure Engageli has permission to share and record your screen.\n\nIf none of this works, reach out to our Support team.\n\nYou can also use the PDF Live share to\u00a0share a presentation directly in Engageli without sharing your screen.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0Need more help?

Browser-based instructors should click here for instructions.\nEngageli tables are strategically designed to increase collaboration between learners. Tables are built so learners will always be in small groups so there is no need to create breakout rooms for activities. This allows you to create rich learning experiences at the tables, while learners also feel simultaneously connected to the larger class and the instructor.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAdd Tables\n\t\nRename Tables\n\n\nChange the Number of Seats at Tables\n\t\nRemove Table Reservations\n\n\u00a0\n\nAdd Tables\n\nAn Engageli classroom opens with 5 tables, each with 10 seats, by default. As the tables fill with learners, more tables are added automatically. However, you can manually add tables 5 at a time with no more than 40 recommended.\n\nInstructions\n\n1. Navigate to the Tables view.\n\n2. Click the Actions menu.\n\n3. Select Add 5 tables.\n\nNOTE: At this time, you cannot remove tables that have been added to the classroom.\n\n\u00a0\nRename Tables\n\nYou can easily rename the tables in your Engageli classroom. Table names can mirror the instructional model and range from project group names, book characters, or course topics to fun names based on hobbies or interests.\n\nInstructions\n\nDuring Class\n\n1. Go to the TABLES view.\n\n2. Hover over the table you want to rename.\n\n3. Click the existing name of the table.\n\n4. Enter the new name.\n\n5. Click the table to save the change.\n\n6. You will see a confirmation notification at the top of the screen.\n\nNote: The new table names will be saved and persist in the Admin Portal and the next time you log into the classroom.\n\nAdmin Portal\n\n1. Go to the Admin Portal.\n\n2. Click Class Management\u00a0on the left to expand the menu.\u00a0\n\n3. Select your class or use the search field to find your class.\u00a0\n\n4. Click Tables & Preset.\n\n5. Select the row for the table.\n\n6. Enter the new table name.\n\n7. Press Return or Enter on your computer.\n\n8. You will see a confirmation notification at the bottom of the screen.\n\n\u00a0\n\nChange the Number of Seats at Tables\n\nBy default, an Engageli classroom opens with the maximum number of seats allowed at a table: 10. As an instructor, you can easily change the number of seats at a table.\u00a0\u00a0\n\nEngageli classroom with 10 seats per table\n\n\u00a0\n\nInstructions\n\n1. Click the gear icon to open the settings.\n\n2. Select Classroom Configuration.\n\n3. Use the slider to select the number of seats for the tables.\n\n4. Click the Close button. The changes will be applied immediately.\n\nPro Tip! When deciding the number of seats, keep in mind that if you have multiple TAs who will visit tables, an available empty seat will be needed. Instructors, co-instructors, and one TA can visit tables without needing an empty seat.\n\nEngageli classroom with 5 seats per table\n\n\u00a0\n\nRemove Table Reservations\n\nTable reservations ensure that a learner can keep their spot at a table should they lose their internet connection and get logged out of the classroom. When the learner re-joins the classroom, they will automatically be placed at the same table as before. Because of having an assigned seat at the table, a table of seven present learners and three reserved is considered full.\n\nYou may want to remove table reservations to free up space at certain tables or create random table groups without including reservations in the count.\n\nWithin Tables view, you can see all reservations represented by a dotted line around a learner\u2019s profile icon.\n\n\u00a0\n\nInstructions\n\n1. Go to the TABLES view.\n\n2. In the drop-down menu Action, select Remove All Reservations.\u00a0\n\n3. You can remove an individual reservation by clicking on the learner's icon at the table and then removing it.\u00a0\n\nNote: Individual reservations will be automatically removed after 5 minutes of inactivity.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0Need more help?

Click to understand more about Room Mode and Table Mode and how to effectively use Engageli's audio modes to foster active learning and collaboration.\u00a0\n\nEngageli now has two main audio modes, Room Mode and Table Mode.\n\nRoom Mode:\n\nThis is the default when you enter your Engageli classroom. This means that as the instructor you will hear the audio feeds from all learners, and they will hear each other, regardless of where they are seated.\n\nWhen to use: the beginning of class, or entire classroom discussions\n\n\u00a0\n\nTable Mode:\n\nWhen you enable Table Mode, learners will hear only their table mates and you will only hear learners who raise their hands.\u00a0\n\nWhen to use: small group discussions, projects, and other table activities\n\n\u00a0\n\nYou can easily toggle between the two modes from the bottom right corner of the screen.\n\n\u00a0 \n\nIf you or a co-instructor join a table, Engageli automatically switches to Table Mode. When at a table, you will only hear the learners at that table (and any learners at other tables that raise their hands).\u00a0 While an instructor is at a table, no instructor will be able to change the mode to Room Mode.\u00a0\n\nFor learners, the tablemates panel will automatically close when switching the audio mode to Room mode from the Table audio mode so learners direct their attention back to the class.\n\nIf you would like to hear all the learners concurrently while at the podium in Table Mode, click on the three dots and choose \u2018Hear tables while on podium in table mode\u2019.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nYou can hover over the Table Mode and Room Mode buttons to see who you can hear and who can hear you.\u00a0\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: All audio will be recorded in Room Mode and only those on podium (learners with hands raised or instructor(s)) will be recorded in Table Mode.\n\n\u00a0\n\nClick to learn how to add a tag to your presentation for a reminder to switch between Room Mode and Table Mode.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0Need more help?

{"url": "https://support.engageli.com/hc/en-us/articles/4411892514843-Using-Tables-for-Active-Learning-Browser", "html": "Using Tables for Active Learning - Browser\n3 months ago Updated\nFollow\nNot yet followed by anyone\n\nEngageli tables are strategically designed to increase collaboration between learners. Tables are built so learners will always be in small groups and you do not need to create breakout rooms for group activities. This allows you to create rich learning experiences at the tables while learners also feel simultaneously connected to the larger class and the instructor.\n\n\u00a0\n\nJoining Tables\n\nCreating Random Tables Groups\u00a0\n\nMoving learners to different Tables\n\n\u00a0\n\nJoining Tables\n\nJoining tables allows you to leave the podium and \u201cvisit\u201d groups of learners at tables, much like \u201cwalking the room\u201d in an in-person class. This is great for any group work or discussions.\n\nInstructions\n1. To join a table, click the Tables tab.\n2. Hover over the table that you'd like to join and click the JOIN button.\n\nWhen you join the table, you will see, hear, and interact only with members of the table you joined. This is great when groups have a question on an in-class assignment and you don't want to interrupt the entire class.\n\n3. When you are ready to leave the table, click the Back to podium button. Engageli 3.1 users have several options for returning to the podium.\n\nNote: The audio will automatically switch from Room Mode to Table Mode. When you leave the table, you will have to switch the audio setting back to Room Mode to enable a full-class discussion. Click to learn more about the audio settings.\n\nNew in Engageli 3.1!\n\nIn Engageli 3.1, instructors will peek at or observe tables unobtrusively without disturbing the learners.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\nCreating Random Tables Groups\u00a0\n\nThis is a great way to encourage learner engagement is to randomly arrange table groups for discussions.\u00a0\n\nInstructions\n\n1. Go to the Seating Arrangement drop-down menu in the Tables view.\u00a0\n\n2. Select Random Arrangement Table Size.\n\n3. Choose the number of learners you would like at each table. The system will automatically break learners into randomized groups.\n\nYou can also reserve any of the first 3 tables for staff or other participants who you don't want to move during the random arrangement. In Engageli 3.0, this is called Skip Tables.\n\nNote: If learners have a reservation, then they will be treated as learners. Make sure to remove any reservations before you do this! (See instructions on reservations here).\n\nYou can save the table arrangement you created as a preset that you can use again. Click for information on how to create a table preset during a class.\n\n\u00a0\n\nMoving Learners to Different Tables\u00a0\n\nInstructions\n1. Navigate to the Tables view.\n2. Click the profile icon of the learner you wish to move.\n\n3. Choose a new table for the learner from the drop-down menu.\n\n4. Or, you can simply drag and drop the learner to a different table.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0Need more help?

Select Modules from the bottom toolbar. Any modules will appear in the right pane.\n\n2. If the modules have to be completed in order, they will be grayed out until you complete the module. You will also have to complete the tasks in the order assigned\n\n3. If the modules do not have to be completed in order, you can pick any module and tasks to complete.\n\n4. When you finish all the tasks, the module will be marked complete.\n\nPlayback Room Attendance\n\nYou can earn attendance credit by watching the class recording in the Playback Room for any class sessions you missed. Ask your instructor about any policies or guidelines regarding Playback Room attendance.\n\nInvite Other Participants\n\nYou can invite others to a Playback Room for group project work, a study hall session, or to review a class recording or class content as a group.\u00a0\n\nClick By Invitation [link icon] on the bottom right of the screen to get the invite link. In earlier versions of Engageli 3.1, click \"Invite & Info\".\n\nYou can invite participants on the roster or guests who are not on the roster.\u00a0\n\nAs the host who started the group, you will retain the playback controls.

However, if we are not integrated with your institution\u2019s LMS or you want to use specific seating assignments during class, you will need to have a list of learners in the system.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nSetting Up Class Roster\n\n1. Navigate to the Engageli portal and find your classroom.\u00a0\n\n2. Under Details > Roster, upload a list of all learners, TAs, and instructors (including you!) in your class.\u00a0 You can add users individually (plus sign) or through bulk upload (paper with the plus sign - See more detailed instructions below).\u00a0\n\n3. If you are planning to pre-assign seating, you can also include the table number/name you want each student to sit at. See more detailed instructions below.\n\n\u00a0\n\nAdding Class Participants in Bulk\u00a0\n\n1. Bulk add using the .csv template.\n\n2. Click \u2018Samples and templates here\u2019, which will open the template as a Google Document.\u00a0\n\n3. Choose File > Make a copy. You can name this copy whatever you like.\u00a0\n\n4. Fill out the CSV file with a list of learners, instructors, and TAs who should be allowed to join this classroom.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n5. When finished, go to File > Download > Comma-separated values (.csv, current sheet) to save to your computer.\u00a0\n\n6. Upload this roster from your computer into the Roster tab of the Portal.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nAssigning Seats\u00a0\n\nOpen seating is the default, but sometimes it can be helpful to assign seats for certain times during the session. You can save multiple presets to use during different points in the class (e.g. start of class, activity time, quiz time). This allows you to easily \u2018move\u2019 learners into different pre-assigned groups, without having to use time during class creating them. You can assign learners to randomly-combined groups of select sizes (1-10 learners) at any time (see detailed instructions here).\n\n\u00a0\n\n1. Under Tables & Presets > Tables, start by customizing the names for each table (e.g., for project groups) if desired.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n2. Under Tables & Presets > Presets, Click \u2018Samples and templates here\u2019, which will open the template as a Google Document.\u00a0\n\n3. Choose File > Make a copy. You can name this copy whatever you like.\u00a0\n\n4. Add each learner\u2019s email and the table you want them added to upon joining.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nIn this example, we have placed three students in each project group. Upon login, they will automatically be placed at Project Group 1 Table and Project Group 2 Table. Please note: The tables in your .cvs file must match the names of tables you created in step two. If you did not rename tables, use \u201cTable 1\u201d, \u201cTable 2\u201d, as in the default labels.\n\n\u00a0\n\n5. When finished, go to File > Download > Comma-separated values (.csv, current sheet) to save to your computer.\u00a0\n\n6. Click \u2018Upload Preset\u2019\n\n7. Name the preset and add a description if helpful (ex: Group Activity - Use this preset when you start group activity).\u00a0\n\n8. Upload the preset by clicking Files.\n\n\u00a0\n\n9. Once presets have been uploaded, you will see a learner\u2019s assigned location for each preset saved next to their name in the roster tab.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nUsing Presets in the Classroom\u00a0\n\n1. Once in your Classroom, at the relevant time, go to Tables > Seating Arrangement > Apply Preset to apply the desired preset.\u00a0\n\n2. Throughout the class, you can choose different presets and Engageli will move learners automatically. You can learn more about table settings in class here and here.\u00a0\n\nClick to learn how to add a tag to your presentation to easily activate a table preset or put learners into a random table arrangement.\n\nRelated article:\n\nHow to Download Your Class Roster\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0Need more help?

Click to read the Engageli 3.1 release notes.\n\nThere may be some learners or participants who are unable to join the session via their computer or mobile apps due to connectivity issues or who simply want to participate in sessions or meetings by audio only. The dial-in option allows users to join the live session as a learner by calling the session-specific number which can be enabled in the Admin Portal. If learners dial into the session, they will be listed\u00a0in the Class Gallery as anonymous \u201cPhone Guests\u201d and they will not appear in the attendance analytics for the class session. They will be placed at a table like all other learners and will get a notification of any audio changes, so they will know if they are speaking to the whole class or just their tablemates. If they would like to unmute to speak, they can press 2, and repeat to mute. If they would like to come to the Podium to be heard by the whole class, they can press 1, and repeat to lower their hand.\u00a0\n\nBest Practices\n\nIf you have a camera-on policy for your classroom, consider making an allowance for dial-in users, as they will not have the ability to be camera-on.\n\nEnsure you communicate group engagement guidelines, such as when and how you'd like learners to unmute and speak, raise their hands, or when they need to stay muted during presentations of content, direct instruction, videos, etc.\n\nDial-in users will not have a displayed name. To ensure that you provide attendance credit or know who is in attendance, we recommend asking all users to introduce themselves by unmuting and sharing their names and pronouns. You or your staff can document your dial-in users' names in the Notes for future reference.\n\nSet aside 1-2 minutes during table-based activities for learners to introduce themselves at their tables. Assign one group manager or representative to take notes or adds ideas from dial-in users to Whiteboards or shared Google/Microsoft 365 materials, so their contributions are included.\n\nRecord your sessions so that dial-in users can return to the recording in the Playback Room and engage in interactive components such as Polls, Whiteboards, Google/Microsoft 365 materials.\n\nHow dial-in learners appear in the Class Gallery\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0Need more help?

When finished, go to File > Download > Comma-separated values (.csv, current sheet) to save to your computer.\u00a0\n\n6. Upload this roster from your computer into the Roster tab of the Portal.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nAssigning Seats\u00a0\n\nOpen seating is the default, but sometimes it can be helpful to assign seats for certain times during the session. You can save multiple presets to use during different points in the class (e.g. start of class, activity time, quiz time). This allows you to easily \u2018move\u2019 learners into different pre-assigned groups, without having to use time during class creating them. You can assign learners to randomly-combined groups of select sizes (1-10 learners) at any time (see detailed instructions here).\n\n\u00a0\n\n1. Under Tables & Presets > Tables, start by customizing the names for each table (e.g., for project groups) if desired.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n2. Under Tables & Presets > Presets, Click \u2018Samples and templates here\u2019, which will open the template as a Google Document.\u00a0\n\n3. Choose File > Make a copy. You can name this copy whatever you like.\u00a0\n\n4. Add each learner\u2019s email and the table you want them added to upon joining.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nIn this example, we have placed three students in each project group. Upon login, they will automatically be placed at Project Group 1 Table and Project Group 2 Table. Please note: The tables in your .cvs file must match the names of tables you created in step two. If you did not rename tables, use \u201cTable 1\u201d, \u201cTable 2\u201d, as in the default labels.\n\n\u00a0\n\n5. When finished, go to File > Download > Comma-separated values (.csv, current sheet) to save to your computer.\u00a0\n\n6. Click \u2018Upload Preset\u2019\n\n7. Name the preset and add a description if helpful (ex: Group Activity - Use this preset when you start group activity).\u00a0\n\n8. Upload the preset by clicking Files.\n\n\u00a0\n\n9. Once presets have been uploaded, you will see a learner\u2019s assigned location for each preset saved next to their name in the roster tab.\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\nUsing Presets in the Classroom\u00a0\n\n1. Once in your Classroom, at the relevant time, go to Tables > Seating Arrangement > Apply Preset to apply the desired preset.\u00a0\n\n2. Throughout the class, you can choose different presets and Engageli will move learners automatically. You can learn more about table settings in class here and here.\u00a0\n\nClick to learn how to add a tag to your presentation to easily activate a table preset or put learners into a random table arrangement.\n\nRelated article:\n\nHow to Download Your Class Roster\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0Need more help?

{"url": "https://support.engageli.com/hc/en-us/articles/8562644617627-How-to-Track-Learner-Engagement-During-Class", "html": "How to Track Learner Engagement During Class\n1 month ago Updated\nFollow\nNot yet followed by anyone\n\nThere are many ways to track engagement in Engageli. These markers can help you keep a pulse on how the class is engaging with and learning the content so you can adjust as needed.\n\n\u00a0\n\nIndividual Engagement Markers\n\n1. Thumbs up/thumbs down\n\nYou can ask learners to use the reactions to give you a thumbs up or down. Everyone will see the thumbs appear instantly on the screen, but only instructors and TAs will see individual thumbs up/thumbs down on the learners' video feeds in the Class Gallery.\n\nThumbs up or down can be used to get quick feedback, check understanding, or check if learners are paying attention. Some example questions to use with thumbs are:\n\n\"Do you understand the material we just covered?\"\n\"Give me a thumbs up if you can see my screen.\"\n\nPro Tip! Use thumbs up or down to check engagement for learners with their cameras off. When coming back after a break, if many learners turned off their cameras, ask for a thumbs up if learners are back and then look at the class gallery to see how many thumbs up there are.\n\nThere are additional reactions and sounds for learners and instructors. Click here to learn more.\u00a0\n\n2. Green Dot Marker\n\nEach learner has an engagement marker in the bottom right corner of their video feed in the Class Gallery.\n\nThe green dot marker represents when a learner is \"active,\" meaning that they have recently interacted in the classroom in some way. The green dot resets to the maximum size (5) each time a learner does one of the following:\n\nWrites a question or answer in Q&A\nResponds to a poll question\nRaises hand\nLowers hand\nShares screen with their table\nShares screen with their class\nUses thumbs up/down\nUses other emojis reactions\nSends a chat message (private chats are not included)\nInitiates audio activity (speaking, unmuting microphone)\n\nNote: The green marker decays and appears smaller after some time. The decay is linear, from maximum (5) to minimum (0) over three minutes. Hovering over the indicator in a learner\u2019s video feed shows an engagement value out of 5 (Engagement - 5/5). Any form of activity listed above will turn the marker green.\n\nThe gray dot marker replaces the green markers when a learner who was previously active has not recently interacted in the classroom. In general, a green marker will turn gray after three minutes. The gray marker corresponds to an Engagement rating of 0/5.\n\nNo marker simply means the learner has not interacted in the classroom at any point.\n\nThe perforated (dotted) marker indicates that a learner who was seated at a table has left the class. They are still represented in the class by what's called a reservation, as explained in this article.\n\nYou can also see the green dot marker next to the learner's name in the List view in the Tables tab.\n\n\u00a0\n\nTable Engagement\n\nIn addition to the learner\u2019s video feed and the Lists view, the individual engagement markers trigger an engagement indication at the table level, which you can see in the Tables tab at the top of the screen.\n\nSimilar to the green dot marker, the green table ring decays and fades away after some time due to inactivity. The decay is linear, from maximum (5) to minimum (0) over three minutes.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0Need more help?

Go to the Apple icon in the top left corner of your screen.\n\n2. Select System Settings.\n\n3. Select Privacy & Security.\n\n4. Find the Screen Recording option under the Privacy tab of this menu.\n\n5. Flip the switch next to Google Chrome to enable access.\n\n5. If you do not see Google Chrome in the screen recording section, click the plus icon.\n\n\n8. Select Google Chrome from your applications folder, and then click Open.\n\n9. Quit and relaunch the browser.\u00a0\n\nNote: You must restart Google Chrome for these changes to take.\n\n\u00a0\n\nThis is only for Google Chrome and not for the Engageli application. Click here for instructions to resolve screen sharing issues using the Engageli instructor application on a Mac.\u00a0\n\nIf screen sharing issues persist, please see steps below.\u00a0\n\nCheck Sharing Settings\n\nInstructions\n\n1. To check your Sharing settings, go to the Apple icon in the top left corner of your screen.\n\n2. Select System Settings from the drop-down menu.\n\n3. Search for and select Screen Sharing.\n\n4. Check the box for Screen Sharing if it is not already checked.\u00a0\n\nNote: If the box for Remote Management is checked, you might not be able to share your entire screen on Engageli, and will need to contact an Administrator at your institution. However, you will be able to share browser tabs.\n\nYou should now be able to share your screen with the class, but if you are still having trouble you should answer the following questions:\u00a0\n\nWhat device are you using? We currently do not support mobile or tablet devices. If a user is on one of these, instruct them to join via laptop, computer, or Chromebook.\nWhat browser are you using? We currently do not recommend Safari or Firefox browsers. If a user is on one of these, invite them to join Engageli via Chrome, Edge, or a browser on Chromium (Opera, Vivaldi, Brave).\nHave you tried refreshing the browser? If not, instruct the user to refresh the browser (log out and log back in). Simply taking this action can sometimes solve your problem.\u00a0\nDo you have an extension running that is blocking screen sharing? Check your extensions or 3rd party anti-virus software.\nDid your permissions get reset? Sometimes permissions are reset without any notification, so recheck your settings to make sure Engageli has permission to share and record your screen.\n\nIf none of this works, reach out to our Support team.\n\nYou can also use the PDF Live Share to share a presentation directly in Engageli without sharing your screen.\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0\n\n\u00a0Need more help?
