    "html": "Using Tables for Active Learning - Browser\n3 months ago Updated\nFollow\nNot yet followed by anyone\n\nEngageli tables are strategically designed to increase collaboration between learners. Tables are built so learners will always be in small groups and you do not need to create breakout rooms for group activities. This allows you to create rich learning experiences at the tables while learners also feel simultaneously connected to the larger class and the instructor.\n\n \n\nJoining Tables\n\nCreating Random Tables Groups \n\nMoving learners to different Tables\n\n \n\nJoining Tables\n\nJoining tables allows you to leave the podium and “visit” groups of learners at tables, much like “walking the room” in an in-person class. This is great for any group work or discussions.\n\nInstructions\n1. To join a table, click the Tables tab.\n2. Hover over the table that you'd like to join and click the JOIN button.\n\nWhen you join the table, you will see, hear, and interact only with members of the table you joined. This is great when groups have a question on an in-class assignment and you don't want to interrupt the entire class.\n\n3. When you are ready to leave the table, click the Back to podium button. Engageli 3.1 users have several options for returning to the podium.\n\nNote: The audio will automatically switch from Room Mode to Table Mode. When you leave the table, you will have to switch the audio setting back to Room Mode to enable a full-class discussion. Click to learn more about the audio settings.\n\nNew in Engageli 3.1!\n\nIn Engageli 3.1, instructors will peek at or observe tables unobtrusively without disturbing the learners. \n\n \nCreating Random Tables Groups \n\nThis is a great way to encourage learner engagement is to randomly arrange table groups for discussions. \n\nInstructions\n\n1. Go to the Seating Arrangement drop-down menu in the Tables view. \n\n2. Select Random Arrangement Table Size.\n\n3. Choose the number of learners you would like at each table. The system will automatically break learners into randomized groups.\n\nYou can also reserve any of the first 3 tables for staff or other participants who you don't want to move during the random arrangement. In Engageli 3.0, this is called Skip Tables.\n\nNote: If learners have a reservation, then they will be treated as learners. Make sure to remove any reservations before you do this! (See instructions on reservations here).\n\nYou can save the table arrangement you created as a preset that you can use again. Click for information on how to create a table preset during a class.\n\n \n\nMoving Learners to Different Tables \n\nInstructions\n1. Navigate to the Tables view.\n2. Click the profile icon of the learner you wish to move.\n\n3. Choose a new table for the learner from the drop-down menu.\n\n4. Or, you can simply drag and drop the learner to a different table.\n\n \n\n Need more help?

Click to understand more about Room Mode and Table Mode and how to effectively use Engageli's audio modes to foster active learning and collaboration. \n\nEngageli now has two main audio modes, Room Mode and Table Mode.\n\nRoom Mode:\n\nThis is the default when you enter your Engageli classroom. This means that as the instructor you will hear the audio feeds from all learners, and they will hear each other, regardless of where they are seated.\n\nWhen to use: the beginning of class, or entire classroom discussions\n\n \n\nTable Mode:\n\nWhen you enable Table Mode, learners will hear only their table mates and you will only hear learners who raise their hands. \n\nWhen to use: small group discussions, projects, and other table activities\n\n \n\nYou can easily toggle between the two modes from the bottom right corner of the screen.\n\n  \n\nIf you or a co-instructor join a table, Engageli automatically switches to Table Mode. When at a table, you will only hear the learners at that table (and any learners at other tables that raise their hands).  While an instructor is at a table, no instructor will be able to change the mode to Room Mode. \n\nFor learners, the tablemates panel will automatically close when switching the audio mode to Room mode from the Table audio mode so learners direct their attention back to the class.\n\nIf you would like to hear all the learners concurrently while at the podium in Table Mode, click on the three dots and choose ‘Hear tables while on podium in table mode’. \n\n \n\n \n\nYou can hover over the Table Mode and Room Mode buttons to see who you can hear and who can hear you. \n\n\n\n\n\nNote: All audio will be recorded in Room Mode and only those on podium (learners with hands raised or instructor(s)) will be recorded in Table Mode.\n\n \n\nClick to learn how to add a tag to your presentation for a reminder to switch between Room Mode and Table Mode.\n\n \n\n Need more help?

    "html": "What is Roster Seating?\n3 months ago Updated\nFollow\nNot yet followed by anyone\n\nThe first time Roster Seating is used in a classroom, learners are assigned to the table groups initially set up on the class roster in the Admin Portal. These serve as default table assignments.\n\nWhen activated, other learners or TAs without assigned seats are then asked to pick a table.\n\nOnce everyone is seated at a table, this arrangement is locked in as the “Roster Seating” for that particular class once the session is concluded. The last position all learners and TAs occupy will be saved and can be reused any time when you select Roster Seating from the Seating arrangement drop-down menu.\n\n\nWhen Roster Seating is enabled, placeholders or reservations are created for learners who are NOT in the class but are listed on the class roster. You will see them sitting at tables with a dotted line around their initialed icons.\n\nTo clear Roster Seating placeholders or reservations:\n\n1. Go to the Tables tab.\n\n2. In the Seating arrangement drop-down menu, click Remove All Reservations.\n\nNote: If you randomly arrange the class based on table size while Roster Seating is activated, it will also create table reservations for absent learners in the random arrangement. If there are not enough tables to accommodate the random arrangement, more will be added in batches of 5 tables.\n\nWhen to use:\n\nRoster Seating is recommended for instructors who want an assigned seating arrangement. If you activate Roster Seating and move learners to their ‘assigned’ seats at specific tables, you can re-use the same arrangement for future classes.\n\n \n\n \n\n Need more help?

    "html": "Using Tables for Active Learning - Browser\n3 months ago Updated\nFollow\nNot yet followed by anyone\n\nEngageli tables are strategically designed to increase collaboration between learners. Tables are built so learners will always be in small groups and you do not need to create breakout rooms for group activities. This allows you to create rich learning experiences at the tables while learners also feel simultaneously connected to the larger class and the instructor.\n\n \n\nJoining Tables\n\nCreating Random Tables Groups \n\nMoving learners to different Tables\n\n \n\nJoining Tables\n\nJoining tables allows you to leave the podium and “visit” groups of learners at tables, much like “walking the room” in an in-person class. This is great for any group work or discussions.\n\nInstructions\n1. To join a table, click the Tables tab.\n2. Hover over the table that you'd like to join and click the JOIN button.\n\nWhen you join the table, you will see, hear, and interact only with members of the table you joined. This is great when groups have a question on an in-class assignment and you don't want to interrupt the entire class.\n\n3. When you are ready to leave the table, click the Back to podium button. Engageli 3.1 users have several options for returning to the podium.\n\nNote: The audio will automatically switch from Room Mode to Table Mode. When you leave the table, you will have to switch the audio setting back to Room Mode to enable a full-class discussion. Click to learn more about the audio settings.\n\nNew in Engageli 3.1!\n\nIn Engageli 3.1, instructors will peek at or observe tables unobtrusively without disturbing the learners. \n\n \nCreating Random Tables Groups \n\nThis is a great way to encourage learner engagement is to randomly arrange table groups for discussions. \n\nInstructions\n\n1. Go to the Seating Arrangement drop-down menu in the Tables view. \n\n2. Select Random Arrangement Table Size.\n\n3. Choose the number of learners you would like at each table. The system will automatically break learners into randomized groups.\n\nYou can also reserve any of the first 3 tables for staff or other participants who you don't want to move during the random arrangement. In Engageli 3.0, this is called Skip Tables.\n\nNote: If learners have a reservation, then they will be treated as learners. Make sure to remove any reservations before you do this! (See instructions on reservations here).\n\nYou can save the table arrangement you created as a preset that you can use again. Click for information on how to create a table preset during a class.\n\n \n\nMoving Learners to Different Tables \n\nInstructions\n1. Navigate to the Tables view.\n2. Click the profile icon of the learner you wish to move.\n\n3. Choose a new table for the learner from the drop-down menu.\n\n4. Or, you can simply drag and drop the learner to a different table.\n\n \n\n Need more help?

    "html": "How to Set Up Your Class Roster and Assigned Seating\n3 months ago Updated\nFollow\nNot yet followed by anyone\n\nWhy Upload Roster?  Learners entering an Engageli classroom through your institution’s Learning Management System do not need to be pre-added to the Engageli roster for classroom access. However, if we are not integrated with your institution’s LMS or you want to use specific seating assignments during class, you will need to have a list of learners in the system. \n\n \n\nSetting Up Class Roster\n\n1. Navigate to the Engageli portal and find your classroom. \n\n2. Under Details > Roster, upload a list of all learners, TAs, and instructors (including you!) in your class.  You can add users individually (plus sign) or through bulk upload (paper with the plus sign - See more detailed instructions below). \n\n3. If you are planning to pre-assign seating, you can also include the table number/name you want each student to sit at. See more detailed instructions below.\n\n \n\nAdding Class Participants in Bulk \n\n1. Bulk add using the .csv template.\n\n2. Click ‘Samples and templates here’, which will open the template as a Google Document. \n\n3. Choose File > Make a copy. You can name this copy whatever you like. \n\n4. Fill out the CSV file with a list of learners, instructors, and TAs who should be allowed to join this classroom. \n\n \n\n5. When finished, go to File > Download > Comma-separated values (.csv, current sheet) to save to your computer. \n\n6. Upload this roster from your computer into the Roster tab of the Portal. \n\n \n\nAssigning Seats \n\nOpen seating is the default, but sometimes it can be helpful to assign seats for certain times during the session. You can save multiple presets to use during different points in the class (e.g. start of class, activity time, quiz time). This allows you to easily ‘move’ learners into different pre-assigned groups, without having to use time during class creating them. You can assign learners to randomly-combined groups of select sizes (1-10 learners) at any time (see detailed instructions here).\n\n \n\n1. Under Tables & Presets > Tables, start by customizing the names for each table (e.g., for project groups) if desired. \n\n \n\n2. Under Tables & Presets > Presets, Click ‘Samples and templates here’, which will open the template as a Google Document. \n\n3. Choose File > Make a copy. You can name this copy whatever you like. \n\n4. Add each learner’s email and the table you want them added to upon joining. \n\n \n\nIn this example, we have placed three students in each project group. Upon login, they will automatically be placed at Project Group 1 Table and Project Group 2 Table. Please note: The tables in your .cvs file must match the names of tables you created in step two. If you did not rename tables, use “Table 1”, “Table 2”, as in the default labels.\n\n \n\n5. When finished, go to File > Download > Comma-separated values (.csv, current sheet) to save to your computer. \n\n6. Click ‘Upload Preset’\n\n7. Name the preset and add a description if helpful (ex: Group Activity - Use this preset when you start group activity). \n\n8. Upload the preset by clicking Files.\n\n \n\n9. Once presets have been uploaded, you will see a learner’s assigned location for each preset saved next to their name in the roster tab. \n\n \n\nUsing Presets in the Classroom \n\n1. Once in your Classroom, at the relevant time, go to Tables > Seating Arrangement > Apply Preset to apply the desired preset. \n\n2. Throughout the class, you can choose different presets and Engageli will move learners automatically. You can learn more about table settings in class here and here. \n\nClick to learn how to add a tag to your presentation to easily activate a table preset or put learners into a random table arrangement.\n\nRelated article:\n\nHow to Download Your Class Roster\n\n \n\n Need more help?

Playback Rooms are open 24/7 and learners can use them to create online collaborative spaces and complete the assigned tasks together.\n\n \n\nAccessing the Playback Room\n\nYou can access the Playback Room directly from the same link that you use for your live Engageli classes. \n\n1. Open the classroom URL and select Playback room at the top of the screen.\n\n2. Then, click Start my Playback room. \n\nCreate a Collaboration Space for My Group\n\nThe first step for creating a Collaboration Space is to get the invite link for your Playback room. \n\n1. In your Playback room, click By Invitation in the bottom left corner.\n\n2. Click Copy invite link. \n\nYou can send the link to your peers as well as guests.\n\n \n\nInstructions for Engageli 3.41: The first step for creating a Collaboration Space is to create a permanent link for the Playback room. \n\n1.

Click By invitation in the bottom left corner. \n\n2. Select Open. \n\nIn Engageli 3.1.41, to set the room to Public Mode, select Private Mode in the bottom left corner and then switch to Public Mode.\n\nThis is how public Playback rooms appear to users. \n\nAs the host who started the group, you will retain the playback controls. That means you will control which class recording, video, or assignment is selected for review. To pass the playback controls to another participant:\n\n1. Click the Gallery button at the bottom of the screen.\n\n2. Then click the three-dot menu in the person's video feed.\n\n3.

Click to understand more about Room Mode and Table Mode and how to effectively use Engageli's audio modes to foster active learning and collaboration. \n\nEngageli now has two main audio modes, Room Mode and Table Mode.\n\nRoom Mode:\n\nThis is the default when you enter your Engageli classroom. This means that as the instructor you will hear the audio feeds from all learners, and they will hear each other, regardless of where they are seated.\n\nWhen to use: the beginning of class, or entire classroom discussions\n\n \n\nTable Mode:\n\nWhen you enable Table Mode, learners will hear only their table mates and you will only hear learners who raise their hands. \n\nWhen to use: small group discussions, projects, and other table activities\n\n \n\nYou can easily toggle between the two modes from the bottom right corner of the screen.\n\n  \n\nIf you or a co-instructor join a table, Engageli automatically switches to Table Mode. When at a table, you will only hear the learners at that table (and any learners at other tables that raise their hands).  While an instructor is at a table, no instructor will be able to change the mode to Room Mode. \n\nFor learners, the tablemates panel will automatically close when switching the audio mode to Room mode from the Table audio mode so learners direct their attention back to the class.\n\nIf you would like to hear all the learners concurrently while at the podium in Table Mode, click on the three dots and choose ‘Hear tables while on podium in table mode’. \n\n \n\n \n\nYou can hover over the Table Mode and Room Mode buttons to see who you can hear and who can hear you. \n\n\n\n\n\nNote: All audio will be recorded in Room Mode and only those on podium (learners with hands raised or instructor(s)) will be recorded in Table Mode.\n\n \n\nClick to learn how to add a tag to your presentation for a reminder to switch between Room Mode and Table Mode.\n\n \n\n Need more help?

Click to learn more about Engageli 3.1. Click to read the Engageli 3.1 release notes.\n\nThere may be some learners or participants who are unable to join the session via their computer or mobile apps due to connectivity issues or who simply want to participate in sessions or meetings by audio only. The dial-in option allows users to join the live session as a learner by calling the session-specific number which can be enabled in the Admin Portal. If learners dial into the session, they will be listed in the Class Gallery as anonymous “Phone Guests” and they will not appear in the attendance analytics for the class session. They will be placed at a table like all other learners and will get a notification of any audio changes, so they will know if they are speaking to the whole class or just their tablemates. If they would like to unmute to speak, they can press 2, and repeat to mute. If they would like to come to the Podium to be heard by the whole class, they can press 1, and repeat to lower their hand. \n\nBest Practices\n\nIf you have a camera-on policy for your classroom, consider making an allowance for dial-in users, as they will not have the ability to be camera-on.\n\nEnsure you communicate group engagement guidelines, such as when and how you'd like learners to unmute and speak, raise their hands, or when they need to stay muted during presentations of content, direct instruction, videos, etc.\n\nDial-in users will not have a displayed name. To ensure that you provide attendance credit or know who is in attendance, we recommend asking all users to introduce themselves by unmuting and sharing their names and pronouns. You or your staff can document your dial-in users' names in the Notes for future reference.\n\nSet aside 1-2 minutes during table-based activities for learners to introduce themselves at their tables. Assign one group manager or representative to take notes or adds ideas from dial-in users to Whiteboards or shared Google/Microsoft 365 materials, so their contributions are included.\n\nRecord your sessions so that dial-in users can return to the recording in the Playback Room and engage in interactive components such as Polls, Whiteboards, Google/Microsoft 365 materials.\n\nHow dial-in learners appear in the Class Gallery\n\n \n\n Need more help?

Click to learn more about Engageli 3.1. Click to read the Engageli 3.1 release notes.\n\nEngageli Modules allow you to author asynchronous modules for participants, including Engageli recordings, supplemental materials, and content and assessments to enrich the learning experience. Here are a few ways you can use Modules to enhance your learning offerings on Engageli.\n\n \nHigher Education Corporate Settings\n\nEnhance existing course materials: If you’re already teaching live classes on Engageli and you’d like to incorporate more activities or make your existing content or course more engaging, you can now include additional materials as PDFs, add new polls, or provide more information through your own recordings (mp4) or Youtube videos. You can create structured Modules for each unit of your course by adding Tasks within a Module. Each Task within the Module must be completed by the learner within the Playback Room before moving to the next Task, and Modules can also be set to be completed in the required order. Progress trackers will allow you to gate and sequence tasks within Modules for learners.\n\nEnable the flipped classroom or asynchronous class model: If you plan to teach a flipped course or completely asynchronous course, you can do all of the above, as well as create collaborative learning activities for them to complete, such as contributing to editable Google/Microsoft 365 materials or opening and using a whiteboard. You will use the live classroom to create recordings for them to review and can enable these tools and provide instructions for them to collaboratively complete. You can also choose recordings made in any of your Engageli classrooms, or upload any .mp4 recording and add them as a Module. \n\nAssign an asynchronous quiz or assessment: You can use Engageli poll tags in a PDF to create quizzes and assessments to gauge learners' learning and mastery that can be completed in the Module. The system will automatically convert the tags to a poll your learners can answer. You can track progress and surface any learners who may be falling behind or at risk.\n\nGather learner feedback: You can use Engageli poll tags to create surveys to offer learners opportunities to provide feedback about the course and their experience. Learners will be able to provide feedback without using a different tool or worrying about missing a survey link sent in an email.\n\nEnable faculty to work through training or skill-building together: If you are an instructional designer or administrator, you can create university-wide learning content, which groups of faculty and instructors can complete in a Playback Room together. The host of the Playback Room can invite up to 9 other users to review recordings, complete learning activities, brainstorm solutions to teaching challenges, and complete assessments. You can review individual and overall Assignment progress as the course designer or admin.\n\n \nRelated Articles:\nHow to Create Modules\nHow to Track Progress for Modules\n\n \n\n Need more help?

Click to understand more about Room Mode and Table Mode and how to effectively use Engageli's audio modes to foster active learning and collaboration. \n\nEngageli now has two main audio modes, Room Mode and Table Mode.\n\nRoom Mode:\n\nThis is the default when you enter your Engageli classroom. This means that as the instructor you will hear the audio feeds from all learners, and they will hear each other, regardless of where they are seated.\n\nWhen to use: the beginning of class, or entire classroom discussions\n\n \n\nTable Mode:\n\nWhen you enable Table Mode, learners will hear only their table mates and you will only hear learners who raise their hands. \n\nWhen to use: small group discussions, projects, and other table activities\n\n \n\nYou can easily toggle between the two modes from the bottom right corner of the screen.\n\n  \n\nIf you or a co-instructor join a table, Engageli automatically switches to Table Mode. When at a table, you will only hear the learners at that table (and any learners at other tables that raise their hands).  While an instructor is at a table, no instructor will be able to change the mode to Room Mode. \n\nFor learners, the tablemates panel will automatically close when switching the audio mode to Room mode from the Table audio mode so learners direct their attention back to the class.\n\nIf you would like to hear all the learners concurrently while at the podium in Table Mode, click on the three dots and choose ‘Hear tables while on podium in table mode’. \n\n \n\n \n\nYou can hover over the Table Mode and Room Mode buttons to see who you can hear and who can hear you. \n\n\n\n\n\nNote: All audio will be recorded in Room Mode and only those on podium (learners with hands raised or instructor(s)) will be recorded in Table Mode.\n\n \n\nClick to learn how to add a tag to your presentation for a reminder to switch between Room Mode and Table Mode.\n\n \n\n Need more help?

Playback Rooms are open 24/7 and learners can use them to create online collaborative spaces and complete the assigned tasks together.\n\n \n\nAccessing the Playback Room\n\nYou can access the Playback Room directly from the same link that you use for your live Engageli classes. \n\n1. Open the classroom URL and select Playback room at the top of the screen.\n\n2.

If set to Open (or Public Mode), your Playback room appears on the login screen for your classmates and peers and they will be able to join without a guest link.\n\nTo set the room to Open:\n\n1. Click By invitation in the bottom left corner. \n\n2. Select Open. \n\nIn Engageli 3.1.41, to set the room to Public Mode, select Private Mode in the bottom left corner and then switch to Public Mode.\n\nThis is how public Playback rooms appear to users. \n\nAs the host who started the group, you will retain the playback controls. That means you will control which class recording, video, or assignment is selected for review. To pass the playback controls to another participant:\n\n1. Click the Gallery button at the bottom of the screen.\n\n2. Then click the three-dot menu in the person's video feed.\n\n3.

Check your internet connection \n\nOther computers/devices using the same network can cause the network to slow down, which can result in audio and video issues. \n\n2. Switch to Low bandwidth mode\n\nClick the More Actions (three dots) menu at the bottom of your screen, and then click Low bandwidth mode. This mode will save bandwidth by automatically turning off the video feeds of other learners at your table and when learners raise their hands at the podium. Video feeds in the gallery will still be visible in a merged view. The merged gallery view will save bandwidth by merging the gallery into one video feed for all learners instead of having individual video feeds for each learner.\n\n3. Turn off your video\n\nTurning off your video feed is an easy way to lower your computer’s CPU usage and improve network traffic. If needed, discuss with your instructor beforehand, but start your video only when you have to or leave it off for the duration of your class session.\n\n4. Mute your audio\n\nYour audio doesn’t use as much bandwidth as your video, but you can reduce your bandwidth by muting your audio when you’re not speaking. \n\n5. Close other applications\n\nTo free up more network resources, close other applications and programs you do not need during your Engageli session. \n\n \n\nFor optimal performance with Engageli, we recommend keeping your operating system and browsers up to date. You may have trouble using certain features on Engageli if you are joining your virtual classroom in parallel with CPU- intensive applications such as cloud computing and streaming services.\n\n \n\n \n\n Need more help?

    "html": "How to Use the Q&A for Teaching\n6 months ago Updated\nFollow\nNot yet followed by anyone\n\nThe Q&A feature allows instructors and learners to post questions and answers, named or anonymously, that persist across class sessions and between live sessions and the asynchronous Playback Room environment. Instructors can use the Q&A feature as part of a live, hybrid/blended, or asynchronous teaching strategy to allow learners to complete activities, interact with others and provide or receive feedback during class or on their own time. Below are some quick tips for how to use the Q&A feature in your Engageli classroom.\n\n \n\nDuring Class\n\nIcebreakers\n\nPost a fun icebreaker question in the Q&A. This provides an early opportunity for learners to get comfortable sharing and participating in a low-stakes way, building their confidence in the safety and community of the classroom, and finding connections with other learners.\n\nDiscussion Prompts\n\nYou can post a question in the Q&A section related to the topic you plan to discuss in class. Ask learners to post answers about readings or assignments in the Q&A when they join the class.\nSplit the class into small groups, set the timer, and ask learners to discuss their answers with their tablemates to facilitate knowledge sharing.\n\nEncourage Learner Questions\n\nEncourage learners to post questions in the Q&A, and respond to questions posted by their classmates. Anonymous mode encourages participation by allowing learners who are hesitant or shy to post their responses unattributed.*\n\nProvide Clear and Detailed Instructions\n\nUse the Q&A to post detailed activity instructions for individual and group activities.\n\n \n\nPlayback Rooms\n\nPeer-to-Peer Post-Class Learning\n\nLearners can join a Playback Room to review the class recording and discuss a prompt posted in the Q&A. Learners can add questions and responses in the Q&A for the instructor to later review.\nInstructors can direct learners to review a specific class recording that includes an in-class poll. Have the learners pause the video to discuss their responses to the poll question and summarize the group’s findings in the Q&A.\n\nFlipped Classrooms\n\nInstructors can use a Playback Room for flipped classroom instruction:\nLearners can create study hall groups to engage with foundational material in the class recordings or posted in the Q&A to benefit from peer-to-peer learning.\n\nGroup Project Work\n\nLearners can work on group projects. The whiteboard and chat thread can be downloaded, and links to reference materials can be shared in the Q&A.\n\nCommunity-building Learning Activities and Collaborative Interaction\n\nThe Q&A is persistent and present in the live class and the Playback Room. Asynchronous learners can answer the same questions posed in the live session.\n\n \n\n*Samson, P. J. (2017, December). Anonymity In Survey Courses as a Tool for More Diverse Engagement.

    "html": "How to optimize for low bandwidth or CPU - Learners\n3 months ago Updated\nFollow\nNot yet followed by anyone\n\nIf you join an Engageli classroom using an older computer or if you have low internet bandwidth, you can adjust your settings to optimize your learning experience.\n\n \n\n1. Check your internet connection \n\nOther computers/devices using the same network can cause the network to slow down, which can result in audio and video issues. \n\n2. Switch to Low bandwidth mode\n\nClick the More Actions (three dots) menu at the bottom of your screen, and then click Low bandwidth mode. This mode will save bandwidth by automatically turning off the video feeds of other learners at your table and when learners raise their hands at the podium. Video feeds in the gallery will still be visible in a merged view. The merged gallery view will save bandwidth by merging the gallery into one video feed for all learners instead of having individual video feeds for each learner.\n\n3. Turn off your video\n\nTurning off your video feed is an easy way to lower your computer’s CPU usage and improve network traffic. If needed, discuss with your instructor beforehand, but start your video only when you have to or leave it off for the duration of your class session.\n\n4.

Browser-based instructors should click here for instructions.\nThere are many ways to track engagement in Engageli, for individual learners as well as the entire class. These markers can help you keep a pulse on how the class is engaging with and learning the content so you can adjust as needed.\n\n \n\nClass Engagement\n\nIndividual Engagement Markers\n\n \n\nClass Engagement\n\n(Note: At this time, class markers are only available if you are teaching on the instructor application.)\n\n \n\n1. Emojis: The Emoji Thermometer measures learner sentiment. Learners have four emoji options: red, orange, yellow, and green. As learners answer, the thermometer will move up and down. All answers are anonymous, so you will get the aggregate of the responses. \n\nSome example questions to use with Emojis are:\n\n\"How are you feeling today?\"\n\"How confident are you in the material we just covered?\"\n\n2. The Bowtie Thermometer measures aggregate class engagement. As learners interact with the platform, the engagement bar will move up and down. \n\nExamples of platform engagement are: raising hands, chatting, asking questions in Q&A, answering polls/quizzes, giving thumbs up or down, etc.\n\n \n\nIndividual Engagement Markers\n\nIn addition to tracking full class engagement with the engagement thermometers, you can also track individual learner engagement.\n\n \n\n1. Thumbs up/thumbs down: You can ask learners to give you a thumbs up or down. Everyone will see the thumbs appear instantly on the screen, but only instructors and TAs will see individual thumbs up/thumbs down on the learners' video feeds in the Class Gallery.\n\nThumbs up or down can be used to get quick feedback, check understanding, or check if learners are paying attention. Some example questions to use with thumbs are:\n\n\"Do you understand the material we just covered?\"\n\"Give me a thumbs up if you can see my screen.\"\n\nPro Tip! Use thumbs up or down to check engagement for learners with their cameras off. When coming back after a break, if many learners turned off their cameras, ask for a thumbs up if learners are back and then look at the class gallery to see how many thumbs up there are.\n\n  Engageli 3.0 \nIn Engageli 3.0, there are new reactions and sounds for learners and instructors. Click here to learn more.\n\n2. Green Dot marker\n\nEach learner has an engagement marker next to their video feed on the gallery view of the instructor application.\n\n \n\nThe green dot marker represents when a learner is \"active,\" meaning that they have recently interacted in the classroom in some way. The green dot resets to the maximum size (5) each time a learner does one of the following:\n\nWrites a question or answer in Q&A\nResponds to a poll question\nRaises a hand\nShares screen with their table\nShares screen with their class\nUses thumbs up/down\nUses emojis\nInitiates audio activity (speaking, unmuting microphone)\n\nNote: The green marker decays and appears smaller after some time. The decay is linear, from maximum (5) to minimum (0) over three minutes. Hovering over the indicator in a learner’s video feed shows an engagement value out of 5 (Engagement - 5/5). Any form of activity listed above will turn the marker green.\n\nThe gray dot marker replaces the green markers when a learner who was previously active has not recently interacted in the classroom. In general, a green marker will turn gray after three minutes. The gray marker corresponds to an Engagement rating of 0/5.\nNo marker simply means the learner has not interacted in the classroom at any point.\nThe perforated (dotted) marker indicates that a learner who was seated at a table has left the class. They are still represented in the class by what's called a reservation, as explained in this article.\n\nYou can also see the green dot marker in the LISTS view.\n\n \n\n3. Table Engagement\n\nIn addition to the learner’s video feed and LISTS view, the individual engagement markers trigger an engagement indication at the table level, which you can see in the TABLES view.\n\nSimilar to the green dot marker, the green table ring decays and fades away after some time due to inactivity. The decay is linear, from maximum (5) to minimum (0) over three minutes.\n\n \n\n \n\n Need more help?

Click to understand more about Room Mode and Table Mode and how to effectively use Engageli's audio modes to foster active learning and collaboration. \n\nEngageli now has two main audio modes, Room Mode and Table Mode.\n\nRoom Mode:\n\nThis is the default when you enter your Engageli classroom. This means that as the instructor you will hear the audio feeds from all learners, and they will hear each other, regardless of where they are seated.\n\nWhen to use: the beginning of class, or entire classroom discussions\n\n \n\nTable Mode:\n\nWhen you enable Table Mode, learners will hear only their table mates and you will only hear learners who raise their hands. \n\nWhen to use: small group discussions, projects, and other table activities\n\n \n\nYou can easily toggle between the two modes from the bottom right corner of the screen.\n\n  \n\nIf you or a co-instructor join a table, Engageli automatically switches to Table Mode. When at a table, you will only hear the learners at that table (and any learners at other tables that raise their hands).  While an instructor is at a table, no instructor will be able to change the mode to Room Mode. \n\nFor learners, the tablemates panel will automatically close when switching the audio mode to Room mode from the Table audio mode so learners direct their attention back to the class.\n\nIf you would like to hear all the learners concurrently while at the podium in Table Mode, click on the three dots and choose ‘Hear tables while on podium in table mode’. \n\n \n\n \n\nYou can hover over the Table Mode and Room Mode buttons to see who you can hear and who can hear you. \n\n\n\n\n\nNote: All audio will be recorded in Room Mode and only those on podium (learners with hands raised or instructor(s)) will be recorded in Table Mode.\n\n \n\nClick to learn how to add a tag to your presentation for a reminder to switch between Room Mode and Table Mode.\n\n \n\n Need more help?

Under Details > Roster, upload a list of all learners, TAs, and instructors (including you!) in your class.  You can add users individually (plus sign) or through bulk upload (paper with the plus sign - See more detailed instructions below). \n\n3. If you are planning to pre-assign seating, you can also include the table number/name you want each student to sit at. See more detailed instructions below.\n\n \n\nAdding Class Participants in Bulk \n\n1. Bulk add using the .csv template.\n\n2. Click ‘Samples and templates here’, which will open the template as a Google Document. \n\n3. Choose File > Make a copy. You can name this copy whatever you like. \n\n4. Fill out the CSV file with a list of learners, instructors, and TAs who should be allowed to join this classroom. \n\n \n\n5. When finished, go to File > Download > Comma-separated values (.csv, current sheet) to save to your computer. \n\n6. Upload this roster from your computer into the Roster tab of the Portal. \n\n \n\nAssigning Seats \n\nOpen seating is the default, but sometimes it can be helpful to assign seats for certain times during the session. You can save multiple presets to use during different points in the class (e.g. start of class, activity time, quiz time). This allows you to easily ‘move’ learners into different pre-assigned groups, without having to use time during class creating them. You can assign learners to randomly-combined groups of select sizes (1-10 learners) at any time (see detailed instructions here).\n\n \n\n1. Under Tables & Presets > Tables, start by customizing the names for each table (e.g., for project groups) if desired. \n\n \n\n2. Under Tables & Presets > Presets, Click ‘Samples and templates here’, which will open the template as a Google Document. \n\n3. Choose File > Make a copy. You can name this copy whatever you like. \n\n4. Add each learner’s email and the table you want them added to upon joining. \n\n \n\nIn this example, we have placed three students in each project group. Upon login, they will automatically be placed at Project Group 1 Table and Project Group 2 Table. Please note: The tables in your .cvs file must match the names of tables you created in step two. If you did not rename tables, use “Table 1”, “Table 2”, as in the default labels.\n\n \n\n5. When finished, go to File > Download > Comma-separated values (.csv, current sheet) to save to your computer. \n\n6. Click ‘Upload Preset’\n\n7. Name the preset and add a description if helpful (ex: Group Activity - Use this preset when you start group activity). \n\n8. Upload the preset by clicking Files.\n\n \n\n9. Once presets have been uploaded, you will see a learner’s assigned location for each preset saved next to their name in the roster tab. \n\n \n\nUsing Presets in the Classroom \n\n1. Once in your Classroom, at the relevant time, go to Tables > Seating Arrangement > Apply Preset to apply the desired preset. \n\n2. Throughout the class, you can choose different presets and Engageli will move learners automatically. You can learn more about table settings in class here and here. \n\nClick to learn how to add a tag to your presentation to easily activate a table preset or put learners into a random table arrangement.\n\nRelated article:\n\nHow to Download Your Class Roster\n\n \n\n Need more help?

Go to the Apple icon in the top left corner of your screen.\n\n2. Select System Settings.\n\n3. Select Privacy & Security.\n\n4. Find the Screen Recording option under the Privacy tab of this menu.\n\n5. Flip the switch next to Google Chrome to enable access.\n\n5. If you do not see Google Chrome in the screen recording section, click the plus icon.\n\n\n8. Select Google Chrome from your applications folder, and then click Open.\n\n9. Quit and relaunch the browser. \n\nNote: You must restart Google Chrome for these changes to take.\n\n \n\nThis is only for Google Chrome and not for the Engageli application. Click here for instructions to resolve screen sharing issues using the Engageli instructor application on a Mac. \n\nIf screen sharing issues persist, please see steps below. \n\nCheck Sharing Settings\n\nInstructions\n\n1. To check your Sharing settings, go to the Apple icon in the top left corner of your screen.\n\n2. Select System Settings from the drop-down menu.\n\n3. Search for and select Screen Sharing.\n\n4. Check the box for Screen Sharing if it is not already checked. \n\nNote: If the box for Remote Management is checked, you might not be able to share your entire screen on Engageli, and will need to contact an Administrator at your institution. However, you will be able to share browser tabs.\n\nYou should now be able to share your screen with the class, but if you are still having trouble you should answer the following questions: \n\nWhat device are you using? We currently do not support mobile or tablet devices. If a user is on one of these, instruct them to join via laptop, computer, or Chromebook.\nWhat browser are you using? We currently do not recommend Safari or Firefox browsers. If a user is on one of these, invite them to join Engageli via Chrome, Edge, or a browser on Chromium (Opera, Vivaldi, Brave).\nHave you tried refreshing the browser? If not, instruct the user to refresh the browser (log out and log back in). Simply taking this action can sometimes solve your problem. \nDo you have an extension running that is blocking screen sharing? Check your extensions or 3rd party anti-virus software.\nDid your permissions get reset? Sometimes permissions are reset without any notification, so recheck your settings to make sure Engageli has permission to share and record your screen.\n\nIf none of this works, reach out to our Support team.\n\nYou can also use the PDF Live Share to share a presentation directly in Engageli without sharing your screen.\n\n \n\n \n\n Need more help?

To grant permission to share your screen on a Mac computer, click on the Apple icon in the top left corner of your screen.\n\n \n\n2. Select \"System Preferences\" from the drop-down menu.\n\n \n\n3. Select \"Security & Privacy\" from the pop-up window.\n\n \n\n4. Under the Privacy tab, scroll down and select \"Screen Recording.\" Ensure that the Engageli icon is checked.\n\n \n\n5. You will likely be prompted to restart the application for this change to take effect. If you need to do this during class, learners will not be impacted. They will be able to stay logged into the class until you return. \n\n \n\n \n\nSharing Settings\n\n1. To check your “Sharing” settings, click on the Apple icon in the top left corner of your screen.\n\n2. Select “System Preferences” from the drop-down menu.\n\n3. Click “Sharing” from the pop-up window.\n\n \n\n\n4. Check the box for “Screen Sharing” if it is not already selected. \n\nNote: If the box for “Remote Management” is checked, you might not be able to share your entire screen on Engageli, and will need to contact an Administrator at your institution. However, you will be able to share browser tabs.\n\n \n\nYou should now be able to share your screen with the class, but if you are still having trouble you should answer the following questions:\n\n \n\n1. What device are you using? We currently do not support mobile or tablet devices. If a user is on one of these, instruct them to join via laptop, computer, or Chromebook.\n\n2. Do you have 3rd party anti-virus software that is blocking screen sharing? Check your 3rd party anti-virus software.\n\n3. Did your permissions get reset? Sometimes permissions are reset without any notification, so recheck your settings to make sure Engageli has permission to share and record your screen.\n\nIf none of this works, reach out to our Support team.\n\nYou can also use the PDF Live share to share a presentation directly in Engageli without sharing your screen.\n\n \n\n \n\n Need more help?

    "html": "How to Track Learner Engagement During Class\n1 month ago Updated\nFollow\nNot yet followed by anyone\n\nThere are many ways to track engagement in Engageli. These markers can help you keep a pulse on how the class is engaging with and learning the content so you can adjust as needed.\n\n \n\nIndividual Engagement Markers\n\n1. Thumbs up/thumbs down\n\nYou can ask learners to use the reactions to give you a thumbs up or down. Everyone will see the thumbs appear instantly on the screen, but only instructors and TAs will see individual thumbs up/thumbs down on the learners' video feeds in the Class Gallery.\n\nThumbs up or down can be used to get quick feedback, check understanding, or check if learners are paying attention. Some example questions to use with thumbs are:\n\n\"Do you understand the material we just covered?\"\n\"Give me a thumbs up if you can see my screen.\"\n\nPro Tip! Use thumbs up or down to check engagement for learners with their cameras off. When coming back after a break, if many learners turned off their cameras, ask for a thumbs up if learners are back and then look at the class gallery to see how many thumbs up there are.\n\nThere are additional reactions and sounds for learners and instructors. Click here to learn more. \n\n2. Green Dot Marker\n\nEach learner has an engagement marker in the bottom right corner of their video feed in the Class Gallery.\n\nThe green dot marker represents when a learner is \"active,\" meaning that they have recently interacted in the classroom in some way. The green dot resets to the maximum size (5) each time a learner does one of the following:\n\nWrites a question or answer in Q&A\nResponds to a poll question\nRaises hand\nLowers hand\nShares screen with their table\nShares screen with their class\nUses thumbs up/down\nUses other emojis reactions\nSends a chat message (private chats are not included)\nInitiates audio activity (speaking, unmuting microphone)\n\nNote: The green marker decays and appears smaller after some time. The decay is linear, from maximum (5) to minimum (0) over three minutes. Hovering over the indicator in a learner’s video feed shows an engagement value out of 5 (Engagement - 5/5). Any form of activity listed above will turn the marker green.\n\nThe gray dot marker replaces the green markers when a learner who was previously active has not recently interacted in the classroom. In general, a green marker will turn gray after three minutes. The gray marker corresponds to an Engagement rating of 0/5.\n\nNo marker simply means the learner has not interacted in the classroom at any point.\n\nThe perforated (dotted) marker indicates that a learner who was seated at a table has left the class. They are still represented in the class by what's called a reservation, as explained in this article.\n\nYou can also see the green dot marker next to the learner's name in the List view in the Tables tab.\n\n \n\nTable Engagement\n\nIn addition to the learner’s video feed and the Lists view, the individual engagement markers trigger an engagement indication at the table level, which you can see in the Tables tab at the top of the screen.\n\nSimilar to the green dot marker, the green table ring decays and fades away after some time due to inactivity. The decay is linear, from maximum (5) to minimum (0) over three minutes.\n\n \n\n \n\n Need more help?

To grant permission to share your screen on a Mac computer, click on the Apple icon in the top left corner of your screen.\n\n \n\n2. Select \"System Preferences\" from the drop-down menu.\n\n \n\n3. Select \"Security & Privacy\" from the pop-up window.\n\n \n\n4. Under the Privacy tab, scroll down and select \"Screen Recording.\" Ensure that the Engageli icon is checked.\n\n \n\n5.

However, you will be able to share browser tabs.\n\n \n\nYou should now be able to share your screen with the class, but if you are still having trouble you should answer the following questions:\n\n \n\n1. What device are you using? We currently do not support mobile or tablet devices. If a user is on one of these, instruct them to join via laptop, computer, or Chromebook.\n\n2. Do you have 3rd party anti-virus software that is blocking screen sharing? Check your 3rd party anti-virus software.\n\n3. Did your permissions get reset? Sometimes permissions are reset without any notification, so recheck your settings to make sure Engageli has permission to share and record your screen.\n\nIf none of this works, reach out to our Support team.\n\nYou can also use the PDF Live share to share a presentation directly in Engageli without sharing your screen.\n\n \n\n \n\n Need more help?

This allows you to easily ‘move’ learners into different pre-assigned groups without having to use class time to create them.\n\nInstructions\n\nGo to the Admin Portal.\nClick Class Management from the menu on the Left.\nSelect your class from the list of Active Classes or use the search field to find your class.\n\nClick the class name.\nSelect Tables & Presets from the menu on the left.\nClick the Tables tab to add custom names for each table, if desired.                     \nClick the Presets tab to create or upload a preset. \nClick View a sample/CSV template here to open the template as a Google Document.  \nChoose File > Make a copy. You can name this copy whatever you like.\nAdd each learner’s email and the table you want them added to upon joining. In this example, we have placed three students in each project group. Upon login, they will automatically be placed at Project Group 1 table and Project Group 2 table. Please note: The tables in your .cvs file must match the names of the tables you created in step 6. If you did not rename tables, use the default table names: Table 1, Table 2, Table 3, etc. \nWhen finished, go to File > Download > Comma-separated values (.csv, current sheet) to save the file to your computer.\nClick Upload Preset.\nName the preset and add a description if helpful (ex: Group Activity - Use this preset when you start group activity).                                                                \nUpload the preset by clicking Files, and then Add.                         \nOnce presets have been uploaded, you will see a learner’s assigned location for each preset saved next to their name in the Roster tab in the portal. \n\nNote: Without presets, you can still assign learners to randomly-combined groups of select sizes (1-10 learners) at any time.

    "html": "Using an iPad as a Second Monitor\n3 months ago Updated\nFollow\nNot yet followed by anyone\n\nInstructors using Engageli on a browser or the instructor application can use an iPad or other tablet as a second monitor for more screen real estate and a view of the class gallery while sharing presentations and running polls.\n\nThis allows learner videos to be displayed on your computer while the presentation you are sharing is displayed on your iPad. This increases the number of learner videos you can see while you share your screen, so you can observe engagement markers and non-verbal reactions and feedback. \n\n \n\nPro Tip! If you use Apple products, your iPad can work as a second monitor with Sidecar. \n\nCheck to make sure your iPad and computer are compatible with the Sidecar system requirements. \nSign in to iCloud on both devices using the same Apple ID.\nConnect the iPad to your computer using a USB cable, or for a wireless connection, turn on WiFi, Bluetooth, and Handoff on both devices.\nMake sure to use the same WiFi network and Apple ID on both devices.\n\nTo set up Sidecar on your Mac computer:\n\n1. Go to System Settings and click Sidecar.\n\n2. Select your iPad to connect. (If you don’t see your iPad, try restarting both devices.)\n\n3. Go to the Display icon in the top menu.\n\n4. Click the iPad icon and then connect to your iPad. Make sure “Use as a separate display” is checked.\n\n5. Once connected, drag your presentation or document to the right of the screen to display it on your iPad. \n\nAfter sharing your screen, if you change your Engageli view to the class gallery, you’ll still be able to see your presentation on the iPad.\n\nClick here for more information on sharing your screen.\n\n \n\n \n\n Need more help?

Click to read the Engageli 3.1 release notes.\n\nThere may be some learners or participants who are unable to join the session via their computer or mobile apps due to connectivity issues or who simply want to participate in sessions or meetings by audio only. The dial-in option allows users to join the live session as a learner by calling the session-specific number which can be enabled in the Admin Portal. If learners dial into the session, they will be listed in the Class Gallery as anonymous “Phone Guests” and they will not appear in the attendance analytics for the class session. They will be placed at a table like all other learners and will get a notification of any audio changes, so they will know if they are speaking to the whole class or just their tablemates. If they would like to unmute to speak, they can press 2, and repeat to mute. If they would like to come to the Podium to be heard by the whole class, they can press 1, and repeat to lower their hand. \n\nBest Practices\n\nIf you have a camera-on policy for your classroom, consider making an allowance for dial-in users, as they will not have the ability to be camera-on.\n\nEnsure you communicate group engagement guidelines, such as when and how you'd like learners to unmute and speak, raise their hands, or when they need to stay muted during presentations of content, direct instruction, videos, etc.\n\nDial-in users will not have a displayed name. To ensure that you provide attendance credit or know who is in attendance, we recommend asking all users to introduce themselves by unmuting and sharing their names and pronouns. You or your staff can document your dial-in users' names in the Notes for future reference.\n\nSet aside 1-2 minutes during table-based activities for learners to introduce themselves at their tables. Assign one group manager or representative to take notes or adds ideas from dial-in users to Whiteboards or shared Google/Microsoft 365 materials, so their contributions are included.\n\nRecord your sessions so that dial-in users can return to the recording in the Playback Room and engage in interactive components such as Polls, Whiteboards, Google/Microsoft 365 materials.\n\nHow dial-in learners appear in the Class Gallery\n\n \n\n Need more help?

First, check that your camera is on and that you've granted camera permissions.\n\nIf that doesn't work, we're here to help!\n\nClick here if you use a Mac. \n\n \n\nGranting Camera Permission during Class \n\nGranting Camera Permission from Browser\n\nGranting Camera Permission from Computer\n\nIs an Anti-Virus Disabling Your Camera?\n\n \n\n \n\nChecking Your Camera During Class \n\n1. Make sure the camera image indicates that your camera is on. If the camera icon is red, then your camera is off.\n\n \n\n2. Check that you have connected the correct camera to the Engageli classroom through Settings (gear icon).\n\n \n\nGranting Permission to Use Camera from Browser\n\n \n\nGoogle Chrome\n\n1. Click \"Allow\" on the pop-up permission prompt when you first log into your class. \n\n \n\n2. If you do not see this option, click on the lock icon in the top left corner of your screen next to your address bar. Make sure the camera is toggled to \"Allow.\"\n\n \n\n \n\nEdge\n\n1. Click\"Allow\" on the pop-up permission prompters when you first log into your class.\n\n \n\n2. If this is not an option, click on the lock icon in the top left corner of your screen next to your address bar. Ensure from this menu that your camera is set to \"Allow.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\nGranting Permission to Use Camera from Computer (PC)\n\n \n\n1. Go to your system settings, which you can find by searching \"settings\" in your finder.\n\n \n\n \n\n2. Next, click on \"Privacy\" from the resulting menu.\n\n \n\n3. Click \"Camera\" from the privacy menu.\n\n4. Make sure that your camera is allowed on your device (which is the default), and that \"Allow apps to access your camera\" is toggled on.\n\n \n\n \n\n5. Next, scroll down to \"Allow desktop apps to access your camera,\" and ensure that this is toggled on. You should see Engageli on this list.\n\n \n\n \n\n \n\nIs an Anti Virus Disabling Your Camera?\n\nIf none of the above steps solve the camera issue, it is possible that an anti-virus application is disabling your camera. The Kaspersky Anti-Virus software is most commonly seen.\n\nWindows\n\n1. Go to the taskbar and search for the application \"Kapersky Internet Security.\"\n\n2. Navigate to \"Privacy Protection\" and click on \"Webcam Protection.\" \n\n \n\n3. Clicking on the link will reveal checkable boxes.

Playback Rooms are open 24/7 and learners can use them to create online collaborative spaces and complete the assigned tasks together.\n\n \n\nAccessing the Playback Room\n\nYou can access the Playback Room directly from the same link that you use for your live Engageli classes. \n\n1. Open the classroom URL and select Playback room at the top of the screen.\n\n2. Then, click Start my Playback room. \n\nCreate a Collaboration Space for My Group\n\nThe first step for creating a Collaboration Space is to get the invite link for your Playback room. \n\n1.

Click By invitation in the bottom left corner. \n\n2. Select Open. \n\nIn Engageli 3.1.41, to set the room to Public Mode, select Private Mode in the bottom left corner and then switch to Public Mode.\n\nThis is how public Playback rooms appear to users. \n\nAs the host who started the group, you will retain the playback controls. That means you will control which class recording, video, or assignment is selected for review. To pass the playback controls to another participant:\n\n1. Click the Gallery button at the bottom of the screen.\n\n2. Then click the three-dot menu in the person's video feed.\n\n3.

At the beginning of class when learners are entering the classroom, you can engage in community-building chat and general check-ins in Room Mode.\n\n2. After a table-based or group-based discussion/activity that was conducted in Table Mode, you can use this tag to shift back to Room Mode and have an all-class discussion/debrief.\n\nPro Tip! Have learners use the “Raise Hand” button when speaking to the whole class, so all learners see the individual who is speaking.\n\n \n\nIn Table Mode:\n\nThe instructor does not hear learners seated at tables who are unmuted and speaking.\nThe instructor hears learners who are speaking on the podium.\nLearners hear the instructor, their tablemates, and other learners with their hands raised.\n\nIf you or a co-instructor joins a table, Engageli automatically switches to Table Mode (to prevent any table-based or private discussion from being shared with learners at other tables).\n\nWhen to Use\n\n1. You could have the table mode tag on one of your first few slides, as we recommend shifting to Table Mode early in your class session:\n\nYou can convey content without audio disruption from learners who might be unmuted accidentally.\nLearners can easily interact with the instructor and full class by raising their hands.\nLearners are able to “lean over” and ask their tablemates questions without interrupting. \nWhen table activities start, there is no change needed, and learners can just begin working.\nYou can easily either unmute the gallery OR join/observe tables without having to also remember to change audio modes.\n\n2. You could also have this slide present right before a table-based/group-based activity, to prompt a shift to Table Mode.\n\nTo use the Action Tags Lab for Table mode:\n\nGo to the Action Tags Lab in the Admin portal. \nSelect Room mode.

This is great for guest speakers or panelists who are not sharing screens. We recommend that you host a maximum of 10 participants on a panel.\n\n \n\nStarting a Panel\nRemove a Panelist \nEnd a Panel\nGuest Speakers with Screen Sharing Needs\nPanels in Recordings\n\n \n\nStarting a Panel\n\nTo start a panel, you simply add learners to the panel.\n\n1. Select the Class Gallery tab at the top of the screen.\n\n2. Move each panelist into a panel by hovering over their video feed and selecting  Add to Panel. At this time, you must add each learner individually.\n\nThe panelists you have moved will appear in the primary view for all students. We recommend that you host a maximum of 10 participants on a panel.\n\n3. Learners can interact with the panelists by raising their hands to ask questions or through chat.\n\n4.  If you run a poll or need to direct your learners away from the panel, you can always direct their views back to the panel.\n\n      \n\nRemove a Panelist\n\n5. You can remove individual panelists by selecting Remove from panel in the panelist’s video feed.                                                     \n\nEnd a Panel\n\n6. To end the panel, click the Present button at the bottom of the screen and then click  Stop.\n\n \n\nGuest speakers with screen-sharing needs\n\nIf a guest speaker or panelist is planning to share their screen during the presentation, the best option would be to have them raise their hand (to join the podium), then share their screen. That way, learners can see both the speaker and the presentation.\n\n\n\nRecordings\n\nIn a recording, the panel appears as follows. When there are multiple participants in the panel, the screen is filled with video feeds. \n\nPlease Note: Remember that if a panelist shares their screen, the screen share will automatically become the learners’ primary view (not the video feeds on the panel). \n\n \n\n Need more help?

    "html": "How to Track Learner Engagement During Class\n1 month ago Updated\nFollow\nNot yet followed by anyone\n\nThere are many ways to track engagement in Engageli. These markers can help you keep a pulse on how the class is engaging with and learning the content so you can adjust as needed.\n\n \n\nIndividual Engagement Markers\n\n1. Thumbs up/thumbs down\n\nYou can ask learners to use the reactions to give you a thumbs up or down. Everyone will see the thumbs appear instantly on the screen, but only instructors and TAs will see individual thumbs up/thumbs down on the learners' video feeds in the Class Gallery.\n\nThumbs up or down can be used to get quick feedback, check understanding, or check if learners are paying attention. Some example questions to use with thumbs are:\n\n\"Do you understand the material we just covered?\"\n\"Give me a thumbs up if you can see my screen.\"\n\nPro Tip! Use thumbs up or down to check engagement for learners with their cameras off. When coming back after a break, if many learners turned off their cameras, ask for a thumbs up if learners are back and then look at the class gallery to see how many thumbs up there are.\n\nThere are additional reactions and sounds for learners and instructors. Click here to learn more. \n\n2. Green Dot Marker\n\nEach learner has an engagement marker in the bottom right corner of their video feed in the Class Gallery.\n\nThe green dot marker represents when a learner is \"active,\" meaning that they have recently interacted in the classroom in some way. The green dot resets to the maximum size (5) each time a learner does one of the following:\n\nWrites a question or answer in Q&A\nResponds to a poll question\nRaises hand\nLowers hand\nShares screen with their table\nShares screen with their class\nUses thumbs up/down\nUses other emojis reactions\nSends a chat message (private chats are not included)\nInitiates audio activity (speaking, unmuting microphone)\n\nNote: The green marker decays and appears smaller after some time. The decay is linear, from maximum (5) to minimum (0) over three minutes. Hovering over the indicator in a learner’s video feed shows an engagement value out of 5 (Engagement - 5/5). Any form of activity listed above will turn the marker green.\n\nThe gray dot marker replaces the green markers when a learner who was previously active has not recently interacted in the classroom. In general, a green marker will turn gray after three minutes. The gray marker corresponds to an Engagement rating of 0/5.\n\nNo marker simply means the learner has not interacted in the classroom at any point.\n\nThe perforated (dotted) marker indicates that a learner who was seated at a table has left the class. They are still represented in the class by what's called a reservation, as explained in this article.\n\nYou can also see the green dot marker next to the learner's name in the List view in the Tables tab.\n\n \n\nTable Engagement\n\nIn addition to the learner’s video feed and the Lists view, the individual engagement markers trigger an engagement indication at the table level, which you can see in the Tables tab at the top of the screen.\n\nSimilar to the green dot marker, the green table ring decays and fades away after some time due to inactivity. The decay is linear, from maximum (5) to minimum (0) over three minutes.\n\n \n\n \n\n Need more help?

    "html": "How to Set Up and Distribute Documents\n2 months ago Updated\nFollow\nNot yet followed by anyone\n\nYou can distribute a shared document to the entire class or separate documents to each table so that learners can work collaboratively within the Engageli classroom.\n\nLearners will be able to see and edit documents directly on the Engageli screen. This is great for brainstorming sessions, in-class group assignments, worksheets, or presentation preparation.\n\nNote: This feature is best used for files that you want learners to edit together in class. If you wish to simply share notes, presentations, or other files with the class, it is best to upload the file in the Chat. A comprehensive guide on how to use the chat can be found here.\n\nClass Document and Table Documents\nDistribute Documents in Class\nPrepare Shared Table Documents in the Admin Portal\nClass Document and Table Documents\n\nYou distribute two kinds of documents in Engageli: a class document or table documents.\n\nA class document is a file that opens for the entire class to view and edit directly on the Engageli screen.\n\nWhen to use: You can use this feature to distribute a file to learners to collaborate in real-time for full class contributions/activities.\n\nA table document is a file that opens for a particular table. You can have the same file open or different files for different tables.\n\nWhen to use: You can use this feature to distribute a file to learners to collaborate in real-time on table-based activities, peer-to-peer instruction, station-based work, case studies per table, etc. You can distribute:\nOne document shared with all tables\nIndividual documents shared per table\n\nFor either a class document or separate table documents, you can share the following types of files:\n\nGoogle Document, Sheet, and Slides\nMicrosoft 365 Word, Excel, and Powerpoint\n\nNote: Microsoft 365 files open within Engageli in view-only mode. For editing, the files will open in a new tab.\n\nDistribute Documents in Class\n\nYou can distribute documents in class without any prior setup.\n\n1. Start your class.\n\n2. When you are ready to distribute the documents, click the Present button at the bottom of the screen.\n\n3. Select either Distribute Doc or Distribute Docs.\n\n4. For a classroom doc, paste the link to the file you want to share and then click the Share button.\n\n5. For table documents, select the set of files you want to share if you added them to the Admin Portal before class, or click the plus sign to add the links.\n\nNote: You have to add links for each table, even if it’s the same file for each table.\n\nPro tip! Save time by adding table document links to the Admin Portal before class. Add them in the Materials section. At this time, shared class document links cannot be added beforehand, only shared table documents.\n\n6. Learners will then see the document you have shared and be able to edit directly on the documents. \n\nYou can change the links to be shared at any point during the class.\n\nAfter enabling a shared doc, you will see a prompt to change the classroom audio to Table Mode.\n\n7. When you are ready to collect the documents, click the Present button again, and then Stop. After clicking, learners will no longer be able to see or edit the document.\n\nPrepare Shared Table Documents in the Admin Portal\n\n1. Go to the Admin Portal.\n\n2. Click Class Management on the left to expand the menu.\n\n3. Select your class or use the search field to find your class.\n\n4. Click Materials.  \n\n5. If you have sub-rooms created, click which room you want to add materials to, and then select the plus sign.\n\n6. Give the set a name.\n\n7. Select which type of files you want to share (G-Suite or Office 365).\n\n8. Click Add.\n\n9. Paste the shared links for the files you want to distribute in class. You can distribute one document per table. Learners seated at that table will be shown that document after activating the feature during class. \n\n10. Confirm that the linked documents are made editable for/by your class before distributing them. You should do this directly in the Google file or Microsoft 365 file that you plan to share.\n\n \n\nGoogle Suite Microsoft 365\n.  \n\n Need more help?

Playback Rooms are open 24/7 and learners can use them to create online collaborative spaces and complete the assigned tasks together.\n\n \n\nAccessing the Playback Room\n\nYou can access the Playback Room directly from the same link that you use for your live Engageli classes. \n\n1. Open the classroom URL and select Playback room at the top of the screen.\n\n2. Then, click Start my Playback room. \n\nCreate a Collaboration Space for My Group\n\nThe first step for creating a Collaboration Space is to get the invite link for your Playback room. \n\n1.

To access recording settings, go to the Admin Portal. \n\n2. Click Classes [Class Management in Engageli 3.0] on the left to expand the menu. \n\n3. Select your class or use the search field to find your class. \n\n4. Click Details.\n\n5. Select the Configuration tab.\n\n6. Check Record learners' videos if you want to include in the class recordings the video feeds of learners who raise their hands to join the podium. If this option is unchecked, only the learners' audio will be captured in the recording.  \n\n7. Check Auto start recording if you want the recording to automatically start after you log in and launch the classroom. This is helpful in case you forget to start the class recording.\n\nNote: Settings will persist between class sessions. This means the setting(s) you selected most recently will be the default for future classes unless you change it. \n\nNew in Engageli 3.1!\n\nIn Engageli 3.1, instructors and admins have options to record the Class Gallery and make the recording private by default.\n\n \n\nRecording During Class \n\n1. Once the class has started, click the green dot (Record Lecture) to begin recording. Engageli 3.1 users click the Record button at the bottom of the screen. \n\n2. While recording, you can pause, stop, or continue the recording at any time.  \n\n3. If you want to pause the recording, click the red dot (Stop Recording). Engageli 3.1 users click the Record button to pause. \n\n4. If/when you want to resume the recording, click the green dot (Record Lecture) again. Engageli 3.1 users click the Record button again to resume.\n\n5. The recording will stop when class ends.\n\nAfter class, a link to the recording will be emailed to the email address that you used to sign into Engageli. Each instructor listed on the roster will receive the email. The recording link is sent from a \"do not reply\" address, so if you don’t see it within five minutes to one hour, please check your Spam folder. \n\nClick here to learn which components are included in the class recording and ways you can optimize the recording for asynchronous learning in the Playback Room.\n\nRecording Indicator \n\nWhen the class is being recorded, a red dot will appear in the top right corner of the instructor's video. Learners and instructors on the browser will see the following:\n\n \n\nNew in Engageli 3.1!\n\nIn Engageli 3.1, in addition to the red dot, all users will see and hear a notification whenever the recording starts or is paused.\n\nRecordings After Class\n\nAfter class, you can access recordings in the Admin Portal. \n\n1. Under your class, go to Recordings and you will see a list of all recordings.\n\n2. You can easily change the name of the recordings by clicking the titles listed under Name. \n\n3. If needed, you can delete a recording by selecting the checkbox to the left of the name, and then clicking the Delete icon in the upper right corner of the screen.\n\nNew in Engageli 3.1!\n\nIn Engageli 3.1, the Recordings List in the Admin Portal has been enhanced to provide more options for instructors including making recordings private and uploading 3rd party transcripts.\n\nPlayback Rooms \n\nLearners can easily review class recordings in the Playback Room. Playback Rooms are open classrooms where learners can, independently or in a group of up to 10, access class content and engage with the material. Learners can review class recordings, participate in polls, ask and answer questions in the Q&A, take notes, and - if in a group - chat, talk, and learn together.\n\nUsing the same link for logging into the live class, learners select \"Playback room\" at the top of the screen.

Check your extensions or 3rd party anti-virus software.\nDid your permissions get reset? Sometimes permissions are reset without any notification, so recheck your settings to make sure Engageli has permission to share and record your screen.\n\nIf none of this works, reach out to our Support team.\n\nYou can also use the PDF Live Share to share a presentation directly in Engageli without sharing your screen.\n\n \n\n \n\n Need more help?
